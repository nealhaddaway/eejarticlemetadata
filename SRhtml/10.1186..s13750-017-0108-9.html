        <title>How does tillage intensity affect soil organic carbon? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="The loss of carbon (C) from agricultural soils has been, in part, attributed to tillage, a common practice providing a number of benefits to farmers. The promotion of less intensive tillage practices and no tillage (NT) (the absence of mechanical soil disturbance) aims to mitigate negative impacts on soil quality and to preserve soil organic carbon (SOC). Several reviews and meta-analyses have shown both beneficial and null effects on SOC due to no tillage relative to conventional tillage, hence there is a need for a comprehensive systematic review to answer the question: what is the impact of reduced tillage intensity on SOC? We systematically reviewed relevant research in boreo-temperate regions using, as a basis, evidence identified within a recently completed systematic map on the impacts of farming on SOC. We performed an update of the original searches to include studies published since the map search. We screened all evidence for relevance according to predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies were appraised and subject to data extraction. Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the impact of reducing tillage [from high (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT), HT to NT, and from IT to NT] for SOC concentration and SOC stock in the upper soil and at lower depths. A total of 351 studies were included in the systematic review: 18% from an update of research published in the 2&#160;years since the systematic map. SOC concentration was significantly higher in NT relative to both IT [1.18&#160;g/kg&#160;&#177;&#160;0.34 (SE)] and HT [2.09&#160;g/kg&#160;&#177;&#160;0.34 (SE)] in the upper soil layer (0&#8211;15&#160;cm). IT was also found to be significant higher [1.30&#160;g/kg&#160;&#177;&#160;0.22 (SE)] in SOC concentration than HT for the upper soil layer (0&#8211;15&#160;cm). At lower depths, only IT SOC compared with HT at 15&#8211;30&#160;cm showed a significant difference; being 0.89&#160;g/kg [&#177;&#160;0.20 (SE)] lower in intermediate intensity tillage. For stock data NT had significantly higher SOC stocks down to 30&#160;cm than either HT [4.61&#160;Mg/ha&#160;&#177;&#160;1.95 (SE)] or IT [3.85&#160;Mg/ha&#160;&#177;&#160;1.64 (SE)]. No other comparisons were significant. The transition of tilled croplands to NT and conservation tillage has been credited with substantial potential to mitigate climate change via C storage. Based on our results, C stock increase under NT compared to HT was in the upper soil (0&#8211;30&#160;cm) around 4.6&#160;Mg/ha (0.78&#8211;8.43&#160;Mg/ha, 95% CI) over &#8805; 10&#160;years, while no effect was detected in the full soil profile. The results support those from several previous studies and reviews that NT and IT increase SOC in the topsoil. Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more productive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions. The effect of tillage practices on total SOC stocks will be further evaluated in a forthcoming project accounting for soil bulk densities and crop yields. Our findings can hopefully be used to guide policies for sustainable management of agricultural soils."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="The loss of carbon (C) from agricultural soils has been, in part, attributed to tillage, a common practice providing a number of benefits to farmers. The promotion of less intensive tillage practices and no tillage (NT) (the absence of mechanical soil disturbance) aims to mitigate negative impacts on soil quality and to preserve soil organic carbon (SOC). Several reviews and meta-analyses have shown both beneficial and null effects on SOC due to no tillage relative to conventional tillage, hence there is a need for a comprehensive systematic review to answer the question: what is the impact of reduced tillage intensity on SOC? We systematically reviewed relevant research in boreo-temperate regions using, as a basis, evidence identified within a recently completed systematic map on the impacts of farming on SOC. We performed an update of the original searches to include studies published since the map search. We screened all evidence for relevance according to predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies were appraised and subject to data extraction. Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the impact of reducing tillage [from high (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT), HT to NT, and from IT to NT] for SOC concentration and SOC stock in the upper soil and at lower depths. A total of 351 studies were included in the systematic review: 18% from an update of research published in the 2&amp;nbsp;years since the systematic map. SOC concentration was significantly higher in NT relative to both IT [1.18&amp;nbsp;g/kg&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.34 (SE)] and HT [2.09&amp;nbsp;g/kg&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.34 (SE)] in the upper soil layer (0–15&amp;nbsp;cm). IT was also found to be significant higher [1.30&amp;nbsp;g/kg&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.22 (SE)] in SOC concentration than HT for the upper soil layer (0–15&amp;nbsp;cm). At lower depths, only IT SOC compared with HT at 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm showed a significant difference; being 0.89&amp;nbsp;g/kg [±&amp;nbsp;0.20 (SE)] lower in intermediate intensity tillage. For stock data NT had significantly higher SOC stocks down to 30&amp;nbsp;cm than either HT [4.61&amp;nbsp;Mg/ha&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1.95 (SE)] or IT [3.85&amp;nbsp;Mg/ha&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;1.64 (SE)]. No other comparisons were significant. The transition of tilled croplands to NT and conservation tillage has been credited with substantial potential to mitigate climate change via C storage. Based on our results, C stock increase under NT compared to HT was in the upper soil (0–30&amp;nbsp;cm) around 4.6&amp;nbsp;Mg/ha (0.78–8.43&amp;nbsp;Mg/ha, 95% CI) over ≥ 10&amp;nbsp;years, while no effect was detected in the full soil profile. The results support those from several previous studies and reviews that NT and IT increase SOC in the topsoil. Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more productive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions. The effect of tillage practices on total SOC stocks will be further evaluated in a forthcoming project accounting for soil bulk densities and crop yields. Our findings can hopefully be used to guide policies for sustainable management of agricultural soils."/>

The promotion of less intensive tillage practices and no tillage (NT) (the absence of mechanical soil disturbance) aims to mitigate negative impacts on soil quality and to preserve soil organic carbon (SOC). Several reviews and meta-analyses have shown both beneficial and null effects on SOC due to no tillage relative to conventional tillage, hence there is a need for a comprehensive systematic review to answer the question: what is the impact of reduced tillage intensity on SOC?</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>We systematically reviewed relevant research in boreo-temperate regions using, as a basis, evidence identified within a recently completed systematic map on the impacts of farming on SOC. We performed an update of the original searches to include studies published since the map search. We screened all evidence for relevance according to predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies were appraised and subject to data extraction. Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the impact of reducing tillage [from high (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT), HT to NT, and from IT to NT] for SOC concentration and SOC stock in the upper soil and at lower depths.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>A total of 351 studies were included in the systematic review: 18% from an update of research published in the 2 years since the systematic map. SOC concentration was significantly higher in NT relative to both IT [1.18 g/kg ± 0.34 (SE)] and HT [2.09 g/kg ± 0.34 (SE)] in the upper soil layer (0–15 cm). IT was also found to be significant higher [1.30 g/kg ± 0.22 (SE)] in SOC concentration than HT for the upper soil layer (0–15 cm). At lower depths, only IT SOC compared with HT at 15–30 cm showed a significant difference; being 0.89 g/kg [± 0.20 (SE)] lower in intermediate intensity tillage. For stock data NT had significantly higher SOC stocks down to 30 cm than either HT [4.61 Mg/ha ± 1.95 (SE)] or IT [3.85 Mg/ha ± 1.64 (SE)]. No other comparisons were significant.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The transition of tilled croplands to NT and conservation tillage has been credited with substantial potential to mitigate climate change via C storage. Based on our results, C stock increase under NT compared to HT was in the upper soil (0–30 cm) around 4.6 Mg/ha (0.78–8.43 Mg/ha, 95% CI) over ≥ 10 years, while no effect was detected in the full soil profile. The results support those from several previous studies and reviews that NT and IT increase SOC in the topsoil. Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more productive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions. The effect of tillage practices on total SOC stocks will be further evaluated in a forthcoming project accounting for soil bulk densities and crop yields. Our findings can hopefully be used to guide policies for sustainable management of agricultural soils.</p></div></div></section>

Potentially relevant research identified in other languages was reported in Additional file. Every study identified via the update was screened through three stages: title, abstract and full text. At each level, records containing or likely to contain relevant information were retained and taken to the next stage.

<p>For the purposes of critically appraising studies in this systematic review, two of the domains described above (spatial replication and treatment allocation) were summed and scores of 3 or 4 (maximum of 4) were given an appraisal category of ‘high’ validity, whilst those of 2 or below were assigned a ‘low’ validity category. Temporal replication was excluded from the final critical appraisal categorisation, since the majority of studies were single time point studies. Duration of the experiment and sampling depth were excluded because they will be accounted for during statistical modelling within meta-analyses. Where any of the original 5 domains assessed in the systematic map had been awarded a ‘?’, indicating a lack of information, these studies were assigned a category of ‘unclear’. Following critical appraisal, 3 studies were excluded on account of unacceptable susceptibility to bias (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#MOESM3">3</a>).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Data extraction strategy</h3><p>Meta-data were extracted for all studies. This information included the following: citation; study location (country, site, climate zone, latitude and longitude); soil type (classification or percent clay/silt/sand); study description (start year, duration, treatments investigated, cropping system, experimental design); sampling strategy (spatial and temporal replication, subsampling, soil sampling depth, C measurement method). In addition, quantitative data (i.e. study findings) were described (outcome type, units, data location, measure of variability, presence of bulk density) and extracted. Tillage categories for further synthesis were assessed as belonging to one of the following three categories: NT, IT and HT. As discussed above, IT corresponds to methods that do not invert the soil profile and that are performed above 40 cm depth (e.g. disk and chisel tillage). HT corresponds to methods that invert the soil profile (e.g. mouldboard plough and ridge tillage), along with very deep non-inversion tillage performed to 40 cm depth or below (i.e. very deep chisel tillage or subsoiling). This assessment was undertaken by extracting all interventions in the evidence base (machinery, tillage depth and timing) and building a coding tool iteratively. Where information was insufficient to readily allow coding, information gaps were filled using meta-data from other articles based at the same experimental site or using consensus during a meeting of the review team. Where consensus could not be reached, studies were excluded for a lack of information regarding the intervention (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#MOESM3">3</a>).

Data were analysed separately as concentrations and stocks (see Synthesis, below). Where studies reported bulk density and stocks, data were back-transformed into concentration data. Where concentrations were reported with bulk densities that were separated by depth and by treatment, data were converted into stocks using the equation in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#MOESM5">5</a> (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138211/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138211/</a>) and included in both concentration and stocks meta-analyses (n = 55 studies, see systematic map database in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#MOESM6">6</a>).</p><p><i>Effect sizes</i> All studies reported data in comparable units, and as a result, raw mean difference (RMD) was used as the effect size for all studies, preserving original units (g/kg and Mg/ha) and facilitating understanding of meta-analysis outputs. Data were grouped into three paired comparisons: no till versus HT, no till versus IT, and intermediate tillage versus HT. In each case, effect sizes were calculated as the less intensive intervention SOC value minus the more intensive intervention SOC value. Thus, a positive effect size indicates a greater SOC value in the more conservative tillage intervention (i.e. tillage reduction).</p><p>All effect sizes were initially calculated by one reviewer, with double-checking of calculations and all extracted data by the same reviewer and subsequently by a second reviewer.</p><p><i>Measures of variability</i> Standard deviations were pooled across treatments, after coefficients of variation, standard errors and confidence intervals were converted to standard deviations where necessary. Studies that reported overall measures of variability (i.e. standard deviations, standard errors, coefficients of variation, confidence intervals) were converted to overall standard deviations and identified as estimated measures of treatment variability (since they do not precisely reflect variability within each treatment). These estimated variability measures were used in sensitivity analysis to examine the importance of accuracy in variability measures during meta-analysis. The following measures were also converted to overall standard deviations: least square difference, p values, and F-statistics.

In this way, study data were aggregated where provided in smaller increments by calculating a weighted mean for concentration. Where data overlapped one of the above soil layer boundaries (i.e. 15 or 30 cm), data were included in the layer above if the overlapping layer thickness was no more than 5 cm deeper than the specified layer. Similarly, data were included in the lower layer if the overlap was 3 cm or less. This distinction was made in order to remain conservative when separating data into three layers, since SOC concentration differences between tillage treatments are likely to be more pronounced at shallower depths (therefore, including data in layers above that which it belongs to decreases the chance of finding a significant difference). This process is shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig1">1</a>.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig1_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-1-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig1_HTML.gif" alt="figure1" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-1-desc"><p>Soil depth profiles and depth correction factors used in effect size calculation and meta-analysis</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/1" data-track-dest="link:Figure1 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<p>All studies reporting SOC concentrations were given a depth correction factor for data belonging to each of the three depth layers that was used in meta-analysis to weight data that came from incomplete soil layers. This number was calculated as the fraction of the profile covered by the data (e.g. a value of 0.67 for 0–10 cm depth). Where data overlapped one full layer a maximum value of 1 was calculated. No depth correction factors were calculated for the &gt; 30 cm depth layer, however. This correction was avoided for &gt; 30 cm depths since there was no lower boundary for this layer relevant to all studies, making a weighting disproportionate across studies, and since the correlation between SOC concentration and depth below this point was deemed to be inconsequential.</p><p>For stocks data, these layers were: upper layer (0–30 cm) and full profile (0–150 cm). These layers were chosen since it was felt that there was likely to be a significant difference in the impact on SOC stocks based on activities in the upper 30 cm that would manifest differently in the full profile (the maximum measures depth was 150 cm). For each of these two layers the full carbon content of the soil was calculated down to the maximum depth. Studies were either classed as reporting upper or lower maximum depths.</p><p><i>Other calculations</i> Soil USDA texture classifications [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Soil Survey Staff.

<p>where these interactions were significant they were retained in the models. Interactions were not tested for in stocks data meta-analyses due to low sample size and underrepresented subgroups.</p><p>When we present our results we present first the results of a basic meta-analysis (i.e. models without moderators). We then tested for the presence of heterogeneity. Where there was no heterogeneity we did not attempt to include moderators and finished by testing for bias (publication, validity, and variability). Where significant heterogeneity existed, we attempted to include moderators as described above. We then test for residual heterogeneity. If residual heterogeneity remains, we then tested for significance of interaction terms. Because of unexplained heterogeneity and the risks of overparameterisation, we choose to present all models (i.e. both unmoderated and moderated) in an attempt to increase transparency. We avoid using models with heterogeneity or overparameterisation when making conclusions, since these models are not reliable.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec20">Sensitivity analyses</h4><p>Sensitivity analyses were carried out for each model to investigate the influence of critical appraisal categories and types of variability measures used. Firstly, for each of the 15 models above additional models were fitted using just those studies assessed as being ‘high’ validity. Secondly, separate models were fitted using only those studies that reported individual variability measures (i.e. separated by treatment group). For both sets of analyses, the results were compared to the overall model fit to examine significant differences in mean effect sizes.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec21">Duplicate studies</h4><p>Study site was denoted as a random factor in the model, accounting for multiple studies being undertaken on some sites. There is no clear distinction in the evidence base between studies and experiments, since the physical experiments exist independently of studies that measure their outcomes. Often, single experiments are measured multiple times, since they are long-term experimental set-ups. Similarly, at any one site experiments can be established independent of one another, whilst research authors do not typically identify on which fields or plots the experiments were undertaken. In order to remain conservative in our analysis we could remove all duplicate studies, but this is an inherently challenging task due to the lack of detail in the study reports. Therefore, we have chosen to retain all studies in our analysis and treat each study as a random factor nested within study site locations.</p><p><i>Assumptions and other tests</i> Heterogeneity was tested for amongst the evidence base by calculating τ<sup>2</sup> and performing Q/QE tests for heterogeneity/residual heterogeneity [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 50" title="Cochran WG.

Significant heterogeneity indicates the presence of a moderator that has not been accounted for in the model. Heterogeneity was tested for in simple univariate meta-analysis models (declaring study code and site as nested random factors) and again following the addition of moderators to examine the influence of including moderators on residual heterogeneity.</p><p>The presence of publication bias was investigated by performing an Egger’s regression test, and by plotting funnel plots (effect sizes against standard errors) and looking for asymmetry, which is indicative of publication bias.</p><p>The influence of individual studies was examined by plotting Cook’s Distance for each study [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Viechtbauer W, Cheung MWL.

Where categorical moderators were significant, boxplots for these subgroup analyses were produced using coefficients from full moderated models (having tested and then removed the moderators climate zone and latitude where necessary). Where continuous moderators and interactions were significant, scatterplots for these meta-regressions were produced using coefficients from full moderated models (having tested and then removed the moderators climate zone and latitude where necessary). Regression lines are plotted from model coefficients that account for moderators (and climate zone or latitude where significant).</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec23"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec23-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec23">Results</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec23-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Review descriptive statistics</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec25">Numbers of relevant articles/studies and their sources</h4><p>A total of 288 articles and 351 studies were included in the systematic review (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#MOESM3">3</a>).

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec29">Soil sampling</h4><p>A large proportion of the evidence base only sampled one soil layer (105 studies), whilst 149 studies (42%) sampled 3 or more layers (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig9">9</a>). Only 1 study failed to report the sampling depth measured. The soil sampling depth critical appraisal scoring was undertaken as follows: ‘0’, shallow (maximum depth ≤ 15 cm) single or multiple sampling; ‘1’, plough layer (maximum depth 15–25 cm) single or multiple sampling, or deep (maximum depth &gt; 25 cm) single sampling; ‘2’, multiple deep sampling (maximum depth &gt; 25 cm). A total of 95 studies were given a score of 0, 118 studies a score of 1, and 138 studies a score of 2, demonstrating a relatively even distribution of soil sampling strategies. For studies reporting concentration data (see ‘Outcome reporting’ below), 265 reported data for the 0–15 cm layer, 112 for the 15–30 cm layer, and 66 for the &gt; 30 cm layer. For studies reporting stocks data, the median soil depth sampled was between 15 and 30 cm (67 studies), whilst other depths were less common: 0–15 cm, 34 studies; 30–75 cm, 29 studies; &gt; 75 cm, 16 studies.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-9"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig9" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 9</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/9" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig9_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-9-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig9_HTML.gif" alt="figure9" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-9-desc"><p>Number of soil samples measured within studies in the review</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/9" data-track-dest="link:Figure9 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec30">Outcome reporting</h4><p>Virtually all studies reported SOC (336 studies), whilst a small number reported SOM that was converted to SOC as described previously (15 studies). Over half of the studies reported concentration data alone (195 studies: 56%), 92 studies reported only stocks (26%), and 64 studies (18%) reported both together. Just over half of all studies reported bulk densities (183 studies: 52%), with similar rates of reporting for studies with concentration data (56%) as for studies with stocks data (58%) (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig10">10</a>). A large number of studies failed to provide measures of variability (i.e. standard deviation, standard error, 95% confidence intervals and coefficients of variation) around their means (111 concentration studies, 41%; 85 stocks studies, 58%), precluding them from inclusion in any form of meta-analysis. Relatively few studies provided variability measures separated by tillage treatment groups (30 and 24% for concentration and stocks studies, respectively), however, the body of evidence that was meta-analysable was greater than these numbers, since some studies provided overall variability measures (for treatments groups combined, some form of pooled measure), some studies provided raw data, and some studies provided p values and least square difference (LSD) values that permitted pooled or individual variability measures to be calculated (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Tab5">5</a>). The use of these other forms of variability measure allowed us to increase the meta-analysable body of evidence from 81 to 160 studies for concentration data meta-analyses, and from 35 to 61 studies for stocks data meta-analyses.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-10"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig10" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 10</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/10" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig10_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-10-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig10_HTML.gif" alt="figure10" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-10-desc"><p>Number of studies reporting concentration and stock data that also report bulk density</p></div></div><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/10" data-track-dest="link:Figure10 Full size image" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>

As mentioned above, spatial replication was relatively low (82% studies with a score of ‘0’ or ‘1’). Temporal replication was also low, with the majority of studies conducting sampling at one time point. In general treatment allocation was of high validity, with the majority of studies (85%) employing some form of blocking (typically also employing randomisation, see above). The majority of studies scored poorly for experimental duration (69% with a score of ‘0’), being conducted over 10–20 years. Soil sampling was generally of moderate validity, with most studies scoring ‘2’ in this domain: these studies performed deep sampling with multiple layers sampled separately.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-11"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig11" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 11</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/11" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig11_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-11-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig11_HTML.gif" alt="figure11" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-11-desc"><p>Critical appraisal scores across the evidence base for five assessed domains.

We therefore choose to present all model results for transparency.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec36">Concentration data</h4><p>Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig12">12</a> and Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Tab8">8</a> display the summary effect estimates for all of the nine meta-analyses on concentration data. These estimates are for the basic models and do not account for moderators, discussed below. Their purpose is to identify clear patterns. A lack of significance does not indicate no significant patterns within the evidence and can only be interpreted as a lack of evidence for an effect if there is no indication of heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity exists, moderators may be significantly driving different patterns within the evidence. As such, we will not discuss this plot further, but rather examine each meta-analysis in detail in the following pages.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-12"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig12" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 12</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/12" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig12_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-12-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig12_HTML.gif" alt="figure12" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-12-desc"><p>Summary effect estimates (difference in SOC, g/kg) for concentration data meta-analyses.

There was no significant heterogeneity present in this model (Q<sub>19</sub> = 16.044 p = 0.654). As expected, the interaction terms and the single moderators, latitude and climate zone, were therefore not significant.

<p>Moderators did not reduce the residual heterogeneity in the model significantly (QE<sub>7</sub> = 17.5621 p = 0.014). Latitude was positively correlated with difference in SOC stocks for the full profile (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig38">38</a>). The analysis of soil class suffered from a lack of data and low sample size, although data suggest that silty loams (SiLo) had a more positive response that the rest of the evidence base that mostly missed data (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig39">39</a>). The analysis of HT depth similarly suffered from a low sample size, with significance likely due to spurious differences between deep tillage studies and those missing this information (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig40">40</a>).

<p>Inclusion of moderators in the model explained the significant heterogeneity (QE<sub>5</sub> = 3.063 p = 0.690).

Due to low sample size in certain subgroups (e.g. deep IT), these results should be viewed with caution (no regression lines have been plotted, accordingly). Longer studies are associated with more positive differences in SOC, and clay (Cl) and clay loam (ClLo) soils appear to show positive and negative impacts on SOC stocks for the full soil profile of a switch to NT from IT, respectively. The significant pattern in IT depth is likely driven by the large body of evidence that does not state tillage depth.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-45"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig45" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 45</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/45" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig45_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-45-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig45_HTML.gif" alt="figure45" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-45-desc"><p>Meta-regression of difference in SOC stock for NT–IT against study duration in full soil profile. <i>NT</i> no tillage, <i>IT</i> intermediate intensity tillage (see text for explanation).

<p>The inclusion of moderators in the model accounted for the significant heterogeneity (QE<sub>17</sub> = 7.968 p = 0.967).

Study duration was positively correlated with difference in SOC, although the power of this analysis was low due to a relatively small sample size (regression line not plotted in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig50">50</a>).

In a C-depleted soil (e.g. a soil with 10 g SOC/kg soil) a small SOC input into the soil profile sequestered by roots and organisms will become a detectable difference, while the same addition of SOC in a soil with an initially higher SOC level (e.g. 40 g/kg) will give a relatively lower increase of SOC.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec41">Reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>The starting premise of this review was to include studies of more than 10 years’ duration to ensure that treatment differences would be detected [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Haddaway NR, Hedlund K, Jackson LE, Kätterer T, Lugato E, Thomsen IK, Jørgensen HB, Söderström B.

Analysis of relationships between study duration and SOC concentrations and stocks in the upper layers of soil confirmed that 10 years was indeed a valid minimum intervention period.

In fact, half of the studies of this systematic review reported only C concentration (e.g. g/kg or %), corroborating the requirement for addressing soil quality and reducing, at the same time, the cost and time necessary to carry out the additional bulk density sampling and analysis.</p><p>However, SOC concentration alone may be less adequate if the focus is on a quantitative SOC balance, such as is necessary for assessments of carbon sequestration capacity for climate change mitigation.

Bulk density measurements undoubtedly give more transparency to the experimental results but may not guarantee the greatest accuracy, if depth is not properly considered.

Cumulative meta-analysis suggests this may not be necessary for the larger meta-analyses, however.</p><p>Whilst we have attempted to account for various moderators in our analyses, we have often run the risk of over parameterisation. We have chosen to be transparent and supply results for both basic (unmoderated) and moderated models, but the risk of over-parameterisation would be reduced in future as more research is published, particularly where information is richer, for example soil texture data, allowing a greater proportion of the evidence base to be included in complex analyses. Similarly, we have not removed outliers, but we have plotted influential studies. Since out meta-analyses are relatively large, the influence of single studies is unlikely to be unacceptably large. We appreciate that another approach could have been to remove outliers and repeat analyses, but we felt that transparency about these analyses was more appropriate than removing studies based on their influence.</p><p>It was not possible with the available resources and the volume of evidence to assess the effect of combining tillage with other interventions, such as amendments, crop rotation or fertiliser. Some 49% of the studies in the evidence base involved such factorial or combined analyses, and further investigation of these 172 studies would provide useful insights for practitioners attempting to reduce SOC loss from their soils.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec46">Limitations of the evidence base</h4><p>Due to the volume of evidence that we have encountered relating to the impacts of tillage on SOC the search update has taken 9 person months to screen, critically appraise, extract data from and integrate into the ongoing synthesis of evidence from the existing systematic map. In addition, the high publication rate of relevant research over the past 2 years (20% of the total evidence base across a 27 year history) indicates that evidence will continue to be published at this rate or higher in the coming years. Together, these facts mean that future syntheses could struggle to bring together the rapidly expanding body of evidence in an affordable, timely manner: review updates would essentially involve a similar investment of resources as many other smaller systematic reviews. Furthermore, the length of time needed to update the review could mean that an update is required by the time the review report is published. However, we can be hopeful that the analyses herein would not be significantly affected by the addition of novel research, since the cumulative meta-analysis showed that the last 2 years of evidence were not highly influential in at least one of the analyses.</p><p>A further limitation of the evidence base was missing data and meta-data.

The most common form of missing meta-data was soil descriptions, which hampered our analysis of this source of heterogeneity.

Tillage descriptions (i.e. depth and machinery) were missing in 31% of studies, which made it difficult to investigate the impact of tillage depth and prevented any form of analysis of tillage equipment. Missing quantitative data in the form of variability measures around the mean was also a problem. Over half of the studies in the review failed to report this data. For some of these studies we were able to estimate treatment variability using an overall variability measure, which had no significant impact on our analyses (shown by sensitivity analysis). However, our meta-analyses were smaller than the available evidence, since the studies without true or estimated variability could not be included.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-10"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab10" data-test="table-caption">Table 10 Commonly missing meta-data and data from the evidence base within this review</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/tables/10"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<p>Our sensitivity analyses and assessments of publication bias, on the whole, failed to identify critical bias in the evidence base. However, there were some notable suggestions of publication bias in the concentration data meta-analyses for NT–HT at &gt; 30 cm and IT–HT at 0–15 cm, and in the stocks data meta-analysis at 0–30 cm. All three instances were for positive trends in less precise studies, where more precise studies showed evenly distributed effect sizes. By accounting for variability in weighting our meta-analysis by inverse variance we have attempted to account for some of this publication bias. We also attempted to reduce the possibility for publication bias in the original systematic map by searching for grey literature [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Haddaway NR, Hedlund K, Jackson LE, Kätterer T, Lugato E, Thomsen IK, Jørgensen HB, Söderström B.

Another factor that may limit the impact of publication bias on our review is that SOC data is often not the main outcome of interest for studies in our review: frequently they focus on other outcomes in addition, such as yield, microbial abundance, or greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, there is not such a clear link between significantly positive SOC data and perceived significance by authors, editors and peer-reviewers, possibly reducing the risk of publication bias. However, we should be aware that our effect estimates may slightly overestimate true effects at least for the three comparisons where evidence of publication bias was found.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec47"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec47-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec47">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec47-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec48">Implications for policy and practice</h3><p>The farming community has a strong interest in management practices not only from the perspective of agronomy but also in relation to the climate. Increasing SOC levels in the upper soil layers can reduce costs for nitrogen applications, since higher SOC level can increase the fertiliser efficiency for a given crop [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 94" title="Brady MV, Hedlund K, Cong R-G, Hemerik L, Hotes S, Machado S, Mattsson L, Schulz E, Thomsen IK.

Among a number of management options to increase SOC for farmers, reduced tillage could provide a means to further reduce losses of SOC in the upper soil layers and contribute to economic efficiency in the long run.</p><p>The European agricultural policy that promotes conservation of soil organic matter is outlined in the guidelines for good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 95" title="REGULATION (EU) No 1307/2013. 2013." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#ref-CR95" id="ref-link-section-d618e5037">95</a>]. The policy does not currently contain measures that explicitly deal with tillage, but the results from the meta-analyses contained herein could provide evidence that NT and IT are potential means to promote SOC in the top soil, and thus could be used in formulation of GAECs concerning soils at national levels.</p><p>In the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) soils are considered as an important factor for mitigating C losses, and during the Paris COP meeting in 2015, there was an initiative launched that stated that if soils can annually store 0.4‰ of the global soil stocks this can be used to mitigate a large proportion of the greenhouse gases emissions to the atmosphere [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 96" title="Agenda L-PA.

This will not only mitigate climate change but is also intended to provide better food security by increasing soil fertility. The FAO has also launched the Global Soil Partnership, a voluntary partnership open to governments, regional organisations, institutions and other stakeholders at various levels [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 97" title="FAO.

The Partnership is guided by an intergovernmental technical panel on soils that provides scientific and technical advice on global soil issues addressing sustainable soil management across various sustainable development agendas. The evidence from this systematic review on SOC stocks from a full soil profile does not show a change due to tillage management, though the collection of evidence (and the apparent lack of data from full profiles) can hopefully be used to support further work to find solutions to increase and maintain C stocks in agricultural soils.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec49">Implications for research</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec50">Knowledge gaps and knowledge clusters</h4><p>Across the evidence considered within this systematic review a suite of other management practices was investigated. Farmers rarely make decisions based on single management practices, but rather consider their field management in a holistic way. However, the majority of the evidence base examined the effect of tillage as a standalone practice (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig56">56</a>). Key knowledge gaps, therefore, exist around the combined effects of tillage and amendments (such as farmyard manure application and stubble management) on SOC. Similarly, the combined effects of tillage and fertiliser were poorly studied. These represent partial knowledge gaps where further investigation and possibly primary may be warranted.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-56"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig56" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 56</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9/figures/56" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig56_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-56-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0108-9/MediaObjects/13750_2017_108_Fig56_HTML.gif" alt="figure56" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-56-desc"><p>Pie chart of the key farming practices investigated alongside tillage.

<p>However, a modest evidence base was found relating to the combined impacts of tillage and crop rotations (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0108-9#Fig56">56</a>): some 88 studies. Whilst the large variety of possible rotations may preclude meta-analysis on this number of studies, it may prove fruitful. Furthermore, a combined approach may be particularly appropriate for this topic, whereby primary research aiming to fill this knowledge gap is combined with further synthesis of existing research identified here.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec51">Methodology</h4><p>Our results provide quantitative evidence in support of the previously held view that changes in SOC cannot be detected within a 10 year timeframe [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Smith P.

This evidence should further strengthen guidance to ensure experiments are in place for longer than a decade before measurements aiming to detect SOC change are made, and researchers should ensure that investigations of SOC seek funding to cover periods of more than 10 years of study to have the necessary power to detect significant change.</p><p>Researchers may also benefit particularly from the appraisal that we have undertaken as part of this review. The key limitations to the usefulness of research studies related to missing descriptive information and missing data. Despite the following variables being vital aspects of study design and experimentation, a surprising proportion of the evidence base was deficient for one or more variables, which hampered analysis.</p><p>In particular the following meta-data were poorly documented and should be universally reported in detail to facilitate future analyses:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Study location (i.e. specific geographical location including coordinates).</p></li><li><p>Experimental name or field identifier (if a frequently studied long-term experiment or if multiple long-term experiments conducted at the same site).</p></li><li><p>Study AND experimental timing (i.e. both the period of measurement and the period over which the management practice or experiment was in place).</p></li><li><p>Soil type (reported as clay/silt/sand or universally accepted soil texture classification).</p></li><li><p>Detailed description of the context, including cropping regimes, fertilider rates, soil chemical and physical parameters.</p></li><li><p>Detailed description of the study design and experimental layout, including the type and level of randomisation (i.e. how were plots randomly assigned, at what level of the experimental design was randomisation applied [treatment, block, plot, subplot]), the type of study design used, the level of true spatial replication [block, plot, subplot, split plot], the number of true spatial replicates, the number of temporal replicates and the timing of measurements, the dimension of plots).</p></li><li><p>Detailed descriptions of the sampling design, including the depths at which soil samples were taken, the method of extraction of soil samples, the number of soil samples taken per plot/subplot.</p></li></ul>
<p>An additional significant problem related to missing data, including:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Individual bulk density data across all treatments and depths investigated, including measures of variability where available (rather than means across sites, treatments or depth profiles).</p></li><li><p>Measures of variability separated by treatment, soil depth and other factors considered, including other farming practices such as different crop rotations or fertiliser rates (i.e. standard deviation, 95% confidence interval, standard error).</p></li><li><p>Sample sizes for true replicates (true replicates are those that occur at the same level as the factor of interest, e.g. if tillage treatments are applied to different fields then true replicates must occur at the field scale; subplots are pseudoreplicates).</p></li><li><p>Long-term study data separated over time (i.e. all time points summaries using means for each time, or raw data provided).</p></li></ul>
<p>Wherever possible all raw data should be provided, allowing synthesists to maximize the legacy and impact of primary research. Primary research authors should see secondary synthesis in the form of systematic maps and systematic reviews as a valuable demonstration of impact of their research outputs.
