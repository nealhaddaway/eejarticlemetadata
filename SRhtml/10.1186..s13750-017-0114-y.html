        <title>What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9&#8211;14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations. Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis. Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9–14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend. For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe."/>

Now widespread in human populations and in the environment, several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global scale PFAS concentrations.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer. Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were therefore discussed in a narrative synthesis.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9–14 carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging. Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high statistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe.</p></div></div></section>

<p>At the title and abstract level all retrieved articles were screened by two reviewers. In doubtful cases where it could not be decided whether the article should be included or excluded on the title and abstract level, the article passed to full text screening. To check that the screening was consistent and complied with the agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria, 10% of the retrieved articles were double screened by the other reviewers, and Kappa tests were used to evaluate the consistency of the screening. Screening at the full-text level was conducted in the same manner as at the title and abstract level, including double screening and kappa tests. After double screening the disagreements were discussed by all reviewers. At both title/abstract and full text levels, excluded articles were coded with a reason for exclusion.

To ensure high consistency between the reviewers, 20% of the included articles after full text screening were double-checked and Kappa tests were used to test the consistency. Articles with conflicting judgements and those for which a reviewer was uncertain during single critical appraisal were discussed by the entire review team before any decision was made. These discussions were helpful in gaining an understanding of how others reasoned and led to more consistency in the critical appraisal.</p><p>Prior to critical appraisal the review team designed a critical appraisal tool consisting of a checklist (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#MOESM4">4</a>) and an Excel spreadsheet (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#MOESM5">5</a>). This tool was finalised after publication of the protocol and was therefore not provided in that document. The checklist highlights five aspects of quality directly affecting the internal validity of a temporal PFAS trend study, including (1) selection bias (2) accuracy of dating of samples (3) sample integrity, (4) analytical quality, and (5) study design. For each aspect a number of factors that should be considered during critical appraisal is listed. Brief descriptions of the quality aspects and criteria for high risk of bias are shown in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#Tab1">1</a>.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Description of quality aspects considered in critical appraisal and criteria for high risk of bias</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y/tables/1"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<p>Study length, sampling frequency, and number of individual or pooled samples at each time point were recorded, but these parameters were not in themselves part of the regular critical appraisal. Instead, we evaluated the statistical power according to a method suggested by Nicholson &amp; Fryer [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Nicholson MD, Fryer RJ. The statistical power of monitoring programs. Mar Pollut Bull. 1992;24(3):146–9." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#ref-CR63" id="ref-link-section-d16537e962">63</a>] to detect a fixed average trend of 10% a year, which the above-mentioned parameters affect, and indicated this for each time trend dataset in the results.</p><p>Information important for the assessment of external validity, or how transferable the studies are to the context of the question, were recorded as well. As indicated by the study inclusion criteria, relatively few restrictions regarding populations/subjects were applied.</p><p>Studies where the risk of bias was judged to be unclear (inadequate information) or high (see criteria in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#Tab1">1</a>) for one or more of the quality aspects were excluded from the review. All other studies were included in a narrative synthesis. Considering the broad range of sample types, locations, and substances included in this review (and the complexity of multiple interventions that may interact), it is difficult to define generic criteria for high risk of bias that are completely unambiguous. A certain degree of expert judgement is inevitable and doubtful cases do occur. In such cases we have chosen to be inclusive, but also to be careful to make a note that the risk of bias potentially is high. The judgements for each quality aspect were entered in the critical appraisal sheet (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#MOESM5">5</a>) by indicating whether the risk of bias is high (Yes), may be high (Potentially), low (No), or unclear due to lack of information (Unclear). To be able to evaluate the effects of including doubtful cases (where the risk of bias potentially is high) we divided the included studies into two groups. Studies where a majority of the quality aspects were doubtful were categorized as Medium risk of bias, and studies where a majority of the aspects had low risk of bias were categorized as Low risk of bias. These two groups were then compared and qualitatively evaluated for any systematic differences in study results.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Data extraction strategy</h3><p>Data were extracted and recorded by two of the reviewers. Outcome data and other important study information were extracted from studies with low and medium risk of bias and recorded in pre-designed Excel data sheets. As with the critical appraisal tool, the design of the data sheets were finalised after publication of the protocol and they were therefore not provided in that document. Outcome data included (1) reported time trends (rates of change in concentration), (2) difference in concentration between two or more time points, and (3) raw data (concentrations at each measured time point). Other important study information included geographical location, sample type (air, sediment, water, biological species etc.), matrix (bulk sediment, liver, water, plasma etc.), covariates (age, sex, etc.), sampling strategy (time period covered, number of sampling occasions, number of pooled or individual samples). Data were always recorded as reported in the primary studies, and all necessary transformations and calculations were performed at the analysis stage. In some cases the authors were contacted for complementary information. Repeatability was tested qualitatively. Both reviewers started by extracting data from 10 articles each (in total 20 articles were extracted). The reviewers then checked each other’s data extraction and reconciled any disagreements.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>In this review the potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity listed below were considered. In the review protocol [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Land M, de Wit CA, Cousins IT, Herzke D, Johansson J, Martin JW.

Potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity were evaluated qualitatively by assigning the studies to different categories and assessing whether the results of a particular category deviated from the rest. The list of potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity were compiled by the review team during preparation of the protocol.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p><i>Timing of the study relative to the interventions</i> A study with data from just a few years directly after the intervention is likely to show a smaller effect (or lower power to detect an effect) than a more recent study covering a longer study period after the interventions.</p></li><li><p><i>Proximity to past and present sources</i> Since the interventions are not yet implemented globally, it is reasonable to assume that the effect will be smaller in regions close to present sources compared to regions close to past sources where the interventions have been implemented.</p></li><li><p><i>Geographical differences</i> In areas where phase-out has been implemented, contaminated areas may still be present and leach the phased-out substances to the surrounding environments. However, if any such area is known to affect the studied population the study should not be included in the review.</p></li><li><p><i>Mode of predominant transport of PFASs to the studied site</i> In terrestrial or high-altitude areas where the input of PFASs is dominated by long-range atmospheric transport of volatile precursors, the response to the interventions may be different compared to marine and coastal areas where the PFAS source is dominated by direct long-range transport in the aquatic environment.</p></li><li><p><i>Type of sample and matrix</i> Different sample types have different routes of exposure to PFASs, and the partitioning behaviour of PFASs is different for different matrices.</p></li><li><p><i>Species differences</i> Route of exposure and metabolism differ among different species.</p></li><li><p><i>Study design</i> For human data the results may be different between cross-sectional and prospective studies. For both human and biological data the results may also depend on the studied populations (differences in sex and age etc.).</p></li><li><p><i>Analytical quality</i> In the early years standards were not always available for accurate calibration of the analytical instruments. Both accuracy and precision have been improved in recent years, and studies using archived samples and only the latest analytical techniques may be better at detecting trends.</p></li><li><p><i>Sampling design and quality</i> Long-term studies with targeted and frequent sampling may be better at detecting trends than short-term studies or studies with less frequent sampling.</p></li></ul>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">Data synthesis and presentation</h3><p>We have chosen to synthesise time trends based on our own analysis of raw data as well as on the calculations performed in the original research papers. The main reason for this is that a wide range of different statistical methods were used by different authors to calculate the time trends. For example, some authors treated all samples from a particular time point as independent samples whereas others used the average or median. This affects the degrees of freedom and may also influence the chance to detect a statistically significant trend. Furthermore, some authors assumed a log-linear relationship between concentrations and time, whereas others used e.g. linear or polynomial models. Another problem when comparing different time trends is that different authors used different methods for detecting change-points. Most authors did not justify their choice of change-point, but seem to have picked it based on a visual inspection of the data. We deemed it necessary to treat all datasets the same way and use the same objective method for all studies, making various datasets more comparable. Nevertheless, we also investigated whether our objective change-point analyses differed from the original analyses. However, it should be stressed that we only analysed datasets that were checked or corrected for confounding factors, such as differences in age or sex between time points, because we lacked the resources to make complete statistical models or to filter out true temporal trends in large public databases such as the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).</p><p>In our own analyses, we used median values, geometric means, or arithmetic means (in preferred order) for each particular time point, depending on what was reported, To calculate the time trends we used a log-linear regression model, and the resulting rates of change in concentration are expressed in units of % year<sup>−1</sup>. To detect a change-point we used a technique similar to that outlined by Sturludottir et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Sturludottir E, Gunnlaugsdottir H, Nielsen OK, Stefansson G.

The whole time-series was repeatedly divided into two parts with at least 3 years in each part and log-linear regression lines were fitted to each part and the residual variance was recorded for each combination. The combination of regression lines that gained the smallest variance was compared with a log-linear regression line and the mean for the whole time period with an F-test. The degrees of freedoms were down-adjusted to compensate for the less restrained situation with two regression lines compared to a single regression line. A number of choices were made: (1) Only one change-point was searched for because the time-series were generally too short for several change-points; (2) Data from the identified change-point year was included in both pre- and post-time series. This is a conservative approach which reduces the influence of abrupt changes from one year to the next (which may be an artefact) but may also reduce the chance to detect significant trends on either side of the change-point; (3) The two parts may not necessarily point in different directions (increasing- decreasing) and may not show significant slopes separately, but they still show a significant decrease in residual variance, i.e. they explain significantly more of the variation in PFAS concentration than the mean or a regression line for the whole period; (4) Change-points were searched for in datasets with 7 or more time-points only, and for datasets with fewer time points with a minimum of 4 years, we calculated a log-linear time trend for the whole study period.</p><p>In contrast to what was set out in the protocol [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Land M, de Wit CA, Cousins IT, Herzke D, Johansson J, Martin JW.

It is reasonable to assume that there is a time lag between the interventions and any measurable effects in the environment. Therefore, studies conducted shortly after a phase-out are less likely to show significant effects compared to studies with long time-series after the intervention. However, in the future when a larger number of comparable studies may be available, it is possible that meta-analyses will be feasible.</p><p>The results are presented in horizontal bar charts where each bar represents an individual dataset. The length of the bars shows the study period (years on the x-axis), and colour codes show whether the trends are significantly increasing or decreasing (p &lt; 0.05) or insignificant (p &gt; 0.05). For insignificant trends only, the statistical power to detect a trend is also categorized as sufficient (Power &gt; 0.8) or low (Power &lt; 0.8). If a significant change-point was detected, the change-point is indicated as a narrow black band on the horizontal bar. It is especially important to note that an insignificant trend does not necessarily mean that there is no ‘true’ trend. As we shall see, most of the studies showing insignificant trends have low statistical power to detect even quite high rates of change in concentration. Admittedly, the lack of further quantitative synthesis may encourage vote counting, ignoring effect sizes and differences in reliability between studies. However, we tried to avoid this and we strongly advise the reader to do the same.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec13"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec13-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec13">Results</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec13-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Review descriptive statistics</h3><p>Searches in the literature databases resulted in 10,170 unique records (searches were performed in May 2014, and a search update was conducted on 20 October 2015).

<p>In total, 186 articles and 26 grey literature reports were included based on full text and critically appraised. During this process, which also involved data extraction, it was found that some studies were redundant, i.e. the same data was published in more than one article. In some cases one article had added some data to a previously published time trend, and in such cases we used the study containing the longest study period and/or the study with the most frequent sampling. Redundant studies are listed in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#MOESM3">3</a>, together with a reference to the article that finally was used in this review.

However, not all of these time trends are independent and should not be treated as separate studies. For instance, in one article studying polar bears [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 134" title="Sonne C, Letcher Robert J, Leifsson Pall S, Riget Frank F, Bechshft Thea O, Bossi R, Asmund G, Dietz R.

These two datasets are not independent from each other. Other articles have investigated human populations from the same locations but with different age groups and/or sex. Such datasets may also not be independent from each other. Furthermore, in some investigated populations or matrices the concentrations were above the LOQ in too few samples to allow for a time trend analysis. Data for a total number of 42 different PFASs or precursors were extracted (see “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#Sec15">Narrative synthesis</a>” section). Many of these were analyzed in a limited number of samples presented in only a few articles and were therefore not further considered here. The more frequently analysed substances that this review focused on included C4, C6, C8, C10 sulfonates (i.e., PFBS, PFHxS, PFOS, PFDS) and the precursor FOSA, as well as C7–C14 carboxylates (i.e., PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA, and PFTeDA).

<p>Nine datasets involved food samples, and 31 datasets were found for abiotic environmental samples including air, snow/ice, water, and sediment. Man-made matrices, comprising various commercial products and sewage sludge, made up 16 datasets.

Studies from which included datasets were drawn were largely focused in Europe (Germany, Norway, Sweden), Asia (China and Japan) and the United States. Only one study was included from the southern hemisphere (Australia), and only one study was included from an indigenous northern population (Inuit, Greenland). Most datasets included used cross-sectional sampling of the population in various years, except for one study from Tromso, Norway, where serum from the same male donors was analyzed at 5 sampling times over 28 years (1979–2007), and one study in Gullah African Americans from coastal South Carolina (2003–2013).</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">PFOS</h5><p><i>Change point analysis</i> For PFOS in human samples, twelve datasets containing at least 7 time points were evaluated by change point analysis (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0114-y#Fig6">6</a>). Eleven of these datasets were for European countries, and one was in New York, USA. Nine of these twelve datasets (75%), all in Europe, had a significant change point and most change points were detected between 1998 and 2003. The earliest change point for PFOS was in 1988 for pooled breast milk samples from primiparous women in Stockholm [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 137" title="Sundstrom M, Ehresman David J, Bignert A, Butenhoff John L, Olsen Geary W, Chang S-C, Bergman A.

These reductions in levels in consumer products have not apparently led to a reduction in the levels of PFCAs in digested sewage sludge where no temporal trends have been observed (the only decline was for PFOS). The few studies that reported temporal trends in surface waters all studied coastal areas, likely impacted by municipal waste and industrial discharges from the coast. These studies showed that there may have been recent reductions in releases of PFOS and PFOA that have led to statistically significant declines in surface water concentrations. However, these observed declining temporal trends in PFOS and PFOA in surface waters may not have occurred in remote waters because water bodies remote from emission sources are expected to have a slower time response compared to water bodies nearer to sources. It is not possible to prove this hypothesis because no temporal trends are available for PFCAs and PFSAs in remote surface waters. Remote air has been sampled and there are indications that levels of N-alkyl perfluorooctane sulfonamides and <i>N</i>-alkyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols have declined in the remote atmosphere, but that FTOH levels have increased between 2006 and 2012. Sediment cores showed (for some substances and study sites) statistically significant increases for some PFCAs and for PFOS for the time periods monitored. However, it should be stressed that most sediment cores cover relatively long time periods with relatively low resolution. As a result, the number of sampled time points after the major phase-outs is often relatively low and therefore changes in trends may not be revealed by the available samples.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec32">Biological samples</h4><p>Within the eligible literature for this critical review, we analysed PFAS temporal trends in terrestrial and marine organisms as well as organisms inhabiting the coastal zone such as seabirds.

This illustrates the difficulties in choosing proper statistical methods in temporal trend studies that make it possible to compare the results of different studies. As the error incurred in the original studies’ analyses seems most often to be finding significant changes up or down where they may not actually be present, this may have led to faulty conclusions in these published studies.</p><p>In conclusion, PFOS is not exhibiting any overall trend over time in the organisms studied for temporal changes. Insignificant trends were predominant in mammals and birds, with a few increasing and decreasing trends, but in fish, mussels and loggerhead sea turtle, insignificant and decreasing trends were equally predominant.</p><p>The general geographical pattern indicates insignificantly changing PFOS concentrations in North America, a mixed pattern for Europe and the Arctic with a predominance of insignificant change, and insignificant or increasing trends in the Baltic Sea. Thus, PFOS concentrations do not yet appear to be declining on a global scale after the phase outs. The tendency to increasing temporal trends in the Baltic Sea may be due to its slow turnover time, reflecting a possible delay in the temporal trends as concentrations have not yet reached a plateau.

Different PFASs are therefore not expected to show identical responses to the interventions studied here. Indeed, the results of this systematic review confirm that differences in time trends between different PFASs in the same studies are abundant. But there are also abundant heterogeneities when a particular substance is considered. One of the most striking differences is between human studies and environmental studies for PFOS, PFDS, PFOA, FOSA, and to some extent also PFHxS. For these substances the type of sample is a clear reason for heterogeneity. This is possibly related to differences in the routes of exposure between the sample types. For humans, exposure to these PFASs through commercial products and food contact paper has probably decreased, resulting in declining concentrations in human blood serum. In contrast, due to the very limited degradation of PFAS in the environment, ecosystems continue to be exposed to PFASs already released, and although 15 years have passed since interventions for reducing exposure to PFOS and PFOA were put in place, no clear impact on the environmental concentrations can yet be observed.</p><p>Among human studies, study geographic location can be a reason for heterogeneity. Although there is only one study from China available, this study shows increasing trends for PFOS and PFOA whereas studies in Europe and North America show declining trends. However, this has probably more to do with the scale of the interventions rather than the interventions themselves. The phase-outs and regulations have not been implemented in China, but the production of these substances has rather increased during recent years and the studied population is presumably closer to and more exposed to present sources. The situation in China may thus be considered as a baseline for the regions where the interventions have been implemented. Another example where the study location is a reason for heterogeneity is the situation in Uppsala, Sweden, where contamination of the drinking water probably has affected measured trends of PFBS and PFHxS in human blood serum. In biological (non-human) and abiotic samples the study location may also be a reason for heterogeneity, but no clear patterns could be seen from the available evidence.</p><p>For human studies the choice of population within a study site may also be a reason for heterogeneity. For example, in Munster, Germany, the trend for PFHpA after a change-point was increasing in females whereas it was decreasing in males [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 145" title="Yeung Leo WY, Robinson Shona J, Koschorreck J, Mabury Scott A.

In Shenyang, China, there was a significant increase in PFOS concentrations in females from 1999 to 2002, whereas it was statistically insignificant in males. It also seems that age contributes to heterogeneity. Taking NHANES data from the USA, there are significant decreasing trends for PFOS in all age groups, but for both females and males the magnitude of the decreasing trend increased with decreasing age [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 144" title="Wong F, MacLeod M, Mueller Jochen F, Cousins Ian T.

We do not have any explanation for these heterogeneities observed for sex and age. It has been suggested that elimination of PFOS is enhanced by menstruating women [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 144" title="Wong F, MacLeod M, Mueller Jochen F, Cousins Ian T.

However, as expected, studies with seven or more time points were more likely to detect significant trends or show non-significant trends with high power than studies with a lower number of time points. Other potential reasons for heterogeneity could not be evaluated based on the available evidence.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec43">Review limitations</h3><p>Literature searches in bibliographic databases captured the bulk of relevant studies, judging by the fact that no additional articles was identified when the bibliographies of relevant review articles were screened. The success of grey literature searches were more difficult to assess. Search words in a limited number of languages were used, and specialist websites in a limited number of countries were searched. It is therefore possible that this review has overlooked some evidence, especially from Asia and the southern hemisphere. Future updates of this review should include search for literature published in Chinese languages. All identified grey literature was excluded during critical appraisal due to lack of detail in descriptions of methods, which also could result in overlooking parts of the evidence base. On the other hand, we observed that relevant data found in grey literature in many cases were published also in the academic literature. We believe that the vast majority of reliable high quality data can be found in the academic literature and that grey literature is less important for the question reviewed here.</p><p>There are several limitations in the available evidence base. Most of the included studies were performed in regions where interventions have been implemented (Europe and North America). Little or very little is known about temporal trends of PFASs in Asia and the southern hemisphere. This is troublesome since production of PFASs has been picked up in regions with weaker voluntary phase-outs and regulations, and there are indications that concentrations are increasing in these regions. Due to long-range transport, PFASs released to the environment in these regions may eventually affect also regions where interventions have been implemented. One of the most important limitations in the evidence base is perhaps the limited amount of data on alternatives to phased-out long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs and their precursors. If these substances are replaced by other equally harmful substances very little is gained. However, it is not always clear what the substitutes are and what to look for.</p><p>Looking at the existing studies and datasets, it can be concluded that many of them, especially those investigating environmental samples, have low power to detect significant trends due to short study periods and low frequency of sampling. The inter-annual variation is often relatively large and in such cases fairly long study periods with a high sampling frequency are needed to obtain high statistical power. It can also be concluded that different authors have used different statistical methods to calculate trends, which can make it difficult to compare trends. When we applied the same methods on all available datasets we sometimes observed that our results differed from the results given in the original studies. One additional limitation of the evidence base is that different conclusions may be reached depending on the choice of statistical approach. We are not claiming that our statistical approach is necessarily better (in some cases other approaches can probably be justified), but we have used a consistent and objective method. Also, one limitation in the evidence base is that there is no proper baseline throughout the study periods. Since the interventions are widely implemented and potentially have a global impact it is only possible to compare trends or concentrations before and after an intervention (BA study design), but there is no way to know what the concentrations or trends would have been in the absence of any intervention (CI or BACI study design). Concentration trends in regions where interventions have not been implemented (e.g. China) may be regarded as a post-intervention baseline, but here data are very sparse and they may be affected by the interventions implemented elsewhere.</p><p>We could not see any systematic difference in study results between studies with low and medium risk of bias, respectively. This can be interpreted in two ways. One is of course that the quality of methods is not critical for obtaining reliable results. The other is that our methods for critical appraisal and assessment of risk of bias are flawed. Another limitation of this review is the lack of quantitative synthesis, but for reasons explained in the Methods section we judged it was not feasible to conduct meta-analyses.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec44"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec44-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec44">Review conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec44-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec45">Implication for policy/management</h3><p>The variations in study results between study locations and sample types make it difficult to extrapolate the available evidence to other locations and sample types than those in the studies. Nevertheless, in regions where the studied interventions have been implemented, the concentrations of PFOS, PFDS, and PFOA in humans are generally declining, and increasing concentrations of PFHxS have started to level off in recent years. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors (MeFOSAA, EtFOSAA, FOSAA, FOSA) have also been seen in human studies. The weight of evidence therefore supports that the 3M Co. phase out resulted in a significant and rapid (measurable over approximately 10 years) mitigation of human exposure in North America and Europe. These consistent declining trends in humans are in contrast to results for environmental monitoring, and overall data of our analysis are therefore suggestive that the consistent declining human trends are attributable to lower exposure from direct contact with commercial materials and food-contact media containing electrochemical PFOS, PFOS-precursors and PFOA.</p><p>In contrast, limited data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these substances continued after the 3M Co. phase out. Concentrations of longer-chained PFCAs (PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFDoDA, PFTrDA, PFTeDA) in humans are generally increasing, with no evidence of significantly declining trends in any global region. Thus, the available data do not support that the US EPA Stewardship program, which commenced in 2006, has resulted in significantly declining trends in humans. However, it should be noted that the stewardship program consisted of gradual phase-outs until 2015, whereas only a small number of datasets included samples from years after 2010. Moreover, companies bound to the terms of the Stewardship program represent only 69% of the global capacity for fluoropolymer production, with the other 31% occurring mainly in China, India and Russia by non-signatory companies [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 155" title="European Chemical Agency.

More time will probably be needed to detect any true declining trends of PFNA and longer PFCAs in humans, owing to their biological persistence. New regulatory measures have also only recently been adopted, for example in January 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration banned C8–C18 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) in food contact applications [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 156" title="US Food and Drug Administration.

Most substances show mixed results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power. A small number of studies on coastal surface waters close to urbanized areas have shown decreasing concentrations of PFOS and PFOA, but it is unknown whether trends are similar in more remote areas. However, there are indications that the levels of <i>N</i>-alkyl perfluorooctane sulfonamides and N-alkyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols (precursors of both PFSAs and PFCAs) in the remote atmosphere have declined, and that levels of FTOH (precursor of PFCAs) in contrast have increased in remote air between 2006 and 2012. In biological (non-human) samples, increasing trends predominate for concentrations of long-chain PFCAs such as PFNA-PFTrA.</p><p>Even with time trends covering more than 7 time points, no clear trends could be detected in many of the studies of biological (non-human) samples. There was often also considerable between year variations, which is always a problem with wildlife studies, as there are many confounders that can affect contaminant levels. These studies may be able to show statistically significant trends if they are continued.</p><p>To conclude, there are indications that the implemented phase-outs and regulations have had a positive effect, but not yet universally and not for all PFASs. Different PFASs have different production histories and properties and are therefore not expected to show identical responses to the interventions. Considering a particular substance, one reason for heterogeneity in study results may be related to differences in the route of exposure to PFASs. For humans, the exposure to some PFASs through commercial products and food contact paper has probably decreased, resulting in declining concentrations of these substances in humans. In contrast, due to the very limited degradation of PFAS in the environment, ecosystems will be exposed to already released PFASs for a long time and no clear impact on the environmental concentrations can yet be observed. This systematic review also suggests that one explanation for heterogeneity among human studies may be proximity to past and present sources, which is related to study location and where the interventions have been implemented.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec46">Implication for research</h3><p>The sampling strategy used in a large number of studies has resulted in low power to detect any trends. There is a need for better designed temporal trend studies including proper statistical treatment, long time periods both before and after intervention points, enough time points, well studied matrices/species, good analytical methods and practice, and more targeted sampling. The systematic review included numerous studies using archived samples and directly highlights the value of such material. Continued support for systematic archiving and storage of human and environmental samples is encouraged to allow future temporal trend studies.</p><p>Additional time trend studies are urgently needed for selected PFASs, especially the wide range of alternatives to long-chain PFCAs and PFSAs and their precursors. For example, time trends of PFBS should be monitored in regions other than Europe. There are indications from the one human study available that the temporal trends in China may be different than seen in North America and Europe. Only one study of biological non-human samples was available from Asia. Due to this general lack of data from Asia and the indications of regional differences between Asia and the rest of the world, there is a need for many more temporal trends studies in Asia in both humans and biota. Another clear knowledge gap is the lack of data from the southern hemisphere. In this review only two studies from the southern hemisphere were included, one on PFAAs in human populations in Australia and one on PFCA precursors in air in South America.</p><p>Most environmental studies were in coastal areas (freshwater, marine) and very few in terrestrial species. Thus, discernment of the impact of atmospheric deposition versus transport in rivers and by ocean currents was not possible in this systematic review. However, as the temporal and spatial trends for most long-chain PFCAs were similar and showed increasing trends, even in the few terrestrial species studied, a widespread atmospheric transport of these or precursors that are degraded to these cannot be ruled out but needs to be confirmed. Long-term monitoring of PFASs in abiotic media, especially air, is needed and will likely contribute to a better understanding of the sources leading to increasing long-chain PFCAs in humans and the environment. Also, analysis of multiple PFASs (i.e. multiple PFAS classes, homologues within a class and their structural isomers) in the same temporal sample sets can provide useful information on sources. Continued monitoring of PFOA and longer-chained PFCAs well beyond 2015 will allow the impact of the EPA 2010/2015 Stewardship Program to be properly evaluated.</p></div></div></section>
