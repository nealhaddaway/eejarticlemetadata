        <title>Have wet meadow restoration projects in the Southwestern U.S. been effective in restoring geomorphology, hydrology, soils, and plant species composition? | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Wet meadows occur in numerous locations throughout the American Southwest, but in many cases have become heavily degraded. Among other things they have frequently been overgrazed and have had roads built through them, which have affected the hydrology of these wetland ecosystems. Because of the important hydrologic and ecological functions they are believed to perform, there is currently significant interest in wet meadow restoration. Several restoration projects have been completed recently or are underway in the region, sometimes at considerable expense and with minimal monitoring. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of wet meadow restoration projects in the southwestern United States on geomorphology, hydrology, soils and plant species composition. A secondary objective was to determine the effects of wet meadow restoration projects on wildlife. Electronic databases, internet search engines, websites and personal contacts were used to find articles of relevance to this review. Articles were filtered by title, abstract and full text. Summary information for each of the articles remaining after the filtering process was compiled and used to assess the quality of the evidence presented using two different approaches. Our searches yielded 48 articles, of which 25 were published in peer-reviewed journals, 14 were monitoring or project reports, and 9 were published in conference proceedings or are unpublished theses or manuscripts. A total of 26 operational-scale restoration projects were identified. A wide range of restoration techniques were employed, ranging from small-scale manipulations of stream channels (e.g., riffle structures) to large scale pond-and-plug projects. Other common restoration techniques included fencing to exclude livestock (and sometimes also native ungulates), other forms of grazing management, seeding, and transplanting seedlings. Most of the articles reported that restoration was fully or partially effective, at least in the short-term. However, the relative lack of high quality quantitative data, and especially data extending more than two years after project implementation, greatly limits our ability to determine how effective restoration has truly been in practice. While caution is warranted due to data quality limitations, progress has been made over the past 20 years in wet meadow restoration. In particular, important contributions have been made in restoring the highly degraded wet meadow systems that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively straight gullies. There is evidence, for example, that the pond-and-plug approach is an effective technique for restoring many aspects of these systems, albeit at the cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not necessarily natural features of wet meadows. There is a need to allocate additional effort to project documentation, including better-designed and longer-lasting monitoring programs. One approach that might help is for practitioners to work with scientists from government agencies, local universities and colleges, and other organizations. When this type of collaboration has happened in the past it appears to have been effective. Many important lessons could have been learned, and mistakes avoided, if more effort had been put into documenting both successes and failures of past projects."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="Have wet meadow restoration projects in the Southwestern U.S. been effective in restoring geomorphology, hydrology, soils, and plant species composition?"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="Wet meadows occur in numerous locations throughout the American Southwest, but in many cases have become heavily degraded. Among other things they have frequently been overgrazed and have had roads built through them, which have affected the hydrology of these wetland ecosystems. Because of the important hydrologic and ecological functions they are believed to perform, there is currently significant interest in wet meadow restoration. Several restoration projects have been completed recently or are underway in the region, sometimes at considerable expense and with minimal monitoring. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of wet meadow restoration projects in the southwestern United States on geomorphology, hydrology, soils and plant species composition. A secondary objective was to determine the effects of wet meadow restoration projects on wildlife. Electronic databases, internet search engines, websites and personal contacts were used to find articles of relevance to this review. Articles were filtered by title, abstract and full text. Summary information for each of the articles remaining after the filtering process was compiled and used to assess the quality of the evidence presented using two different approaches. Our searches yielded 48 articles, of which 25 were published in peer-reviewed journals, 14 were monitoring or project reports, and 9 were published in conference proceedings or are unpublished theses or manuscripts. A total of 26 operational-scale restoration projects were identified. A wide range of restoration techniques were employed, ranging from small-scale manipulations of stream channels (e.g., riffle structures) to large scale pond-and-plug projects. Other common restoration techniques included fencing to exclude livestock (and sometimes also native ungulates), other forms of grazing management, seeding, and transplanting seedlings. Most of the articles reported that restoration was fully or partially effective, at least in the short-term. However, the relative lack of high quality quantitative data, and especially data extending more than two years after project implementation, greatly limits our ability to determine how effective restoration has truly been in practice. While caution is warranted due to data quality limitations, progress has been made over the past 20 years in wet meadow restoration. In particular, important contributions have been made in restoring the highly degraded wet meadow systems that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively straight gullies. There is evidence, for example, that the pond-and-plug approach is an effective technique for restoring many aspects of these systems, albeit at the cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not necessarily natural features of wet meadows. There is a need to allocate additional effort to project documentation, including better-designed and longer-lasting monitoring programs. One approach that might help is for practitioners to work with scientists from government agencies, local universities and colleges, and other organizations.

Among other things they have frequently been overgrazed and have had roads built through them, which have affected the hydrology of these wetland ecosystems.</p><p>Because of the important hydrologic and ecological functions they are believed to perform, there is currently significant interest in wet meadow restoration. Several restoration projects have been completed recently or are underway in the region, sometimes at considerable expense and with minimal monitoring. The objective of this review was to evaluate the effects of wet meadow restoration projects in the southwestern United States on geomorphology, hydrology, soils and plant species composition. A secondary objective was to determine the effects of wet meadow restoration projects on wildlife.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Electronic databases, internet search engines, websites and personal contacts were used to find articles of relevance to this review. Articles were filtered by title, abstract and full text. Summary information for each of the articles remaining after the filtering process was compiled and used to assess the quality of the evidence presented using two different approaches.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Our searches yielded 48 articles, of which 25 were published in peer-reviewed journals, 14 were monitoring or project reports, and 9 were published in conference proceedings or are unpublished theses or manuscripts.</p><p>A total of 26 operational-scale restoration projects were identified. A wide range of restoration techniques were employed, ranging from small-scale manipulations of stream channels (e.g., riffle structures) to large scale pond-and-plug projects. Other common restoration techniques included fencing to exclude livestock (and sometimes also native ungulates), other forms of grazing management, seeding, and transplanting seedlings.</p><p>Most of the articles reported that restoration was fully or partially effective, at least in the short-term. However, the relative lack of high quality quantitative data, and especially data extending more than two years after project implementation, greatly limits our ability to determine how effective restoration has truly been in practice.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>While caution is warranted due to data quality limitations, progress has been made over the past 20 years in wet meadow restoration. In particular, important contributions have been made in restoring the highly degraded wet meadow systems that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively straight gullies. There is evidence, for example, that the pond-and-plug approach is an effective technique for restoring many aspects of these systems, albeit at the cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not necessarily natural features of wet meadows.</p><p>There is a need to allocate additional effort to project documentation, including better-designed and longer-lasting monitoring programs. One approach that might help is for practitioners to work with scientists from government agencies, local universities and colleges, and other organizations. When this type of collaboration has happened in the past it appears to have been effective. Many important lessons could have been learned, and mistakes avoided, if more effort had been put into documenting both successes and failures of past projects.</p></div></div></section>

Using the descriptions and types of evidence as guidelines, we then determined if each particular characteristic was addressed and, if so, whether there was sufficient evidence presented to determine if the project was successful in achieving the desired characteristic. For this analysis, we used the five-point rating system shown in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-1-11#Tab2">2</a> and assessed only those articles that presented data for the operational-scale restoration projects, as opposed to articles that presented data collected primarily for research purposes. While we believe that most wet meadow restoration practitioners would agree that these six characteristics are important, they represent our view of what constitutes successful restoration and weren’t always listed as explicit goals in the articles we assessed.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1

Twenty-five of the included articles reported on research that was directly or indirectly related to wet meadow restoration and was published in peer-reviewed journals. Another 14 articles are better described as monitoring or project reports. The remaining 9 articles are mostly conference proceedings and unpublished theses or manuscripts.</p><p>Many articles only addressed one or two of our four main outcomes (i.e. effects on geomorphology, hydrology, soils, and vegetation). Geomorphology was addressed in 20 of the articles, hydrology in 18, soils in 8, and vegetation in 38.

<p>Because of the wide variation in study design, study quality, restoration/research interventions and the way that intervention effects were reported (which in many cases was primarily qualitative), we determined that the use of formal statistical meta-analysis techniques would not be practical. Two additional reasons why we opted not to conduct a meta-analysis include: (1) the relatively short-term nature of the studies, such that the true effects of restoration treatments had not yet been fully tested in many cases and (2) wide year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, especially related to precipitation and its effect on flooding and water table levels, that confounded treatment effects in otherwise well-designed studies e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 26" title="Martin DW, Chambers JC: Effects of water table, clipping, and species interactions on Carex nebrascensis and Poa pratensis in riparian meadows.

<p>None of the characteristics had an average rating above 3 -- the amount of evidence needed to demonstrate partial success. Of greater importance than the average ratings, however, are the individual ratings of either 3 or 4. These ratings indicate where restoration techniques have been effective in improving specific wet meadow characteristics. Out of the total of 162 individual ratings in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-1-11#Tab4">4</a>, there were 12 ratings of 4 (7.4% of the total) and 51 ratings of 3 (31.5% of the total).

In most cases, this involved measures to restore or recreate a stream channel with a gradient, sinuosity, width-to-depth and entrenchment ratios, and other characteristics that were similar to what existed in the meadow prior to stream incision or other alteration.

This technique involves creating a series of earthen plugs in the gully by using fill material from within and adjacent to the gully (thereby creating alternating ponds and plugs). Streamflow is then diverted into either a remnant stream channel or a newly created one on the original floodplain surface. This approach recreates part of the geomorphology of the meadow, but also results in a number of ponds that were not a feature of the original landscape. The pond-and-plug approach was first employed approximately 15 years ago and has been used with increasing frequency, particularly in the Sierra Nevada region of California [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Lindquist DS, Wilcox J Proceedings of the International Erosion Control Association, Conference 31.

Pre- and post-project longitudinal profiles, stream and/or floodplain cross-sections, characterization of streambed particle size, and qualitative evidence (e.g., photo points) were the most frequently used types of evidence. These types of evidence, especially the stream profiles and cross-sections, can effectively demonstrate that the post-project stream or floodplain configuration was similar to specified construction targets or to reference sites in relatively undisturbed meadows e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Wolf E, Cooper D: Restoration of Geomorphic Structure, Hydrologic Regime, and Vegetation in Upper Halstead Meadow.

The best example of this may be the large flooding event withstood by a pond-and-plug project in 2009. The flood, which was determined to be in the 500-year return interval category, impacted the Big Meadows project [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 50" title="Wilcox J: Big Meadows Restoration Project, October 14, 2009 Flood Event.

Virtually no changes in channel morphology or to the plugs were observed despite the flashy nature of this flood and the fact that it occurred at a time of year (October) when the area was dry and the plugs and channel may have been most vulnerable to damage.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Hydrology</h3><p>The efforts to restore geomorphic processes described in the previous section are primarily designed to return streamflow, overbank flooding, ground water levels and other aspects of a site’s hydrology back to close approximations of their former patterns. The best evidence of success in achieving hydrologic restoration comes from direct measurements of these variables pre- and post-project, through the use of stream gauges, groundwater monitoring wells and similar techniques. Relatively few of the articles we reviewed used one or more of these techniques or monitored for sufficient periods of time to demonstrate substantial, long-term improvements in hydrology. Another challenge we faced was that, in some cases where it appears that adequate hydrological data were collected, the documents we reviewed did not present the data in detail.</p><p>Most of the highest quality data we could find on hydrology came from pond-and-plug projects in California, as well as the channel elimination project. One example is the first-ever pond-and-plug project in California, at Big Flat Meadow [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Wild Fish Habitat Initiative: Big Flat Meadow Re-Watering Project. Montana Water Center, University of Montana-Bozeman, Bozeman, MT; 2007. &#xA;                    http://wildfish.montana.edu/Cases/browse_details.asp?ProjectID=43&#xA;                    &#xA;                  &#xA;" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-1-11#ref-CR29" id="ref-link-section-d95658e3079">29</a>]. Monitoring of this project included stream gauges above and below the project site and a network of ground water monitoring wells along transects perpendicular to the stream. Interpretation of the data is somewhat confounded by the wide year-to-year variation in precipitation, but the data appear adequate to demonstrate that flow duration increased, peak flows below the project site decreased, groundwater levels increased, and stream temperature decreased as a result of the project, all of which are positive results.</p><p>A clearer and more dramatic effect on groundwater levels was reported for the Upper Halstead Meadow project. This project sought to eliminate (fill in completely) a gully and to restore a nearly level topography and a sheet flow hydrologic regime to the meadow [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Wolf E, Cooper D: Restoration of Geomorphic Structure, Hydrologic Regime, and Vegetation in Upper Halstead Meadow.

Monitoring wells in this meadow showed wide variations in groundwater levels prior to restoration, with levels commonly dipping below 1.5 m during the growing season. Groundwater levels post-restoration fluctuated very little and remained within 20 cm of the surface for most of the three growing seasons that were monitored. Post-project groundwater levels were very similar to those recorded at five reference sites.</p><p>While other articles or project reports presented evidence of improvements in hydrology, most tended to do so with less data and sometimes relied on a combination of quantitative and qualitative evidence. An example is Medina and Long [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 38" title="Medina AL, Long JW: Placing formations to restore stream functions in a wet meadow.

They reported that the riffles reduced the average distance from the streambed to the bank from 63 cm to 45 cm. This in turn reduced the channel capacity and promoted overbank flooding, while also creating a streambank environment more conducive to the establishment of sedges. Accompanying pre- and post-project photos, showing the development of lush vegetation, provided supporting evidence of the project’s success in restoring both geomorphology and hydrology.</p><p>Several efforts have been made to examine the effects of restoration projects on hydrology using numerical models [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Loheide SP, Deitchman RS, Cooper DJ, Wolf EC, Hammersmark CT, Lundquist JD: A framework for understanding the hydroecology of impacted wet meadows in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges, California, USA.

The decreased runoff and duration of base flow was driven by the raised channel bed and higher evapotranspiration rates.

Both of these issues have reportedly been addressed successfully by refilling the damaged areas with a lighter mix that consisted of 70% soil and 30% sawdust.</p><p>When combined with data collected in the field, the modeling studies described above also provide good quality evidence of changes in vegetation caused by restoration projects.

Although no specific detrimental impacts were reported, this may be one aspect of the pond-and-plug approach that would benefit from additional research. Permanent ponds are not a natural feature of most wet meadows and their presence may alter animal species communities in unintended ways.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec28">Reasons for variation in effectiveness</h3><p>We cannot pinpoint any instances where there was variation in the effectiveness of projects that were truly comparable in terms of ecological setting, disturbance history, and treatments applied. In reality each project was unique. The fact that each meadow and stream complex is unique - and therefore requires site-specific treatments - was mentioned by several of the restoration practitioners and researchers that we contacted during the course of this review.</p><p>In a more general sense, however, there are many factors that can be identified that cause variation in project effectiveness. In the Upper Halstead Meadow Project, for example, the initial effectiveness of the project was reduced by the choice of fill material and by compacting the material excessively. This resulted in both increased susceptibility to erosion and to reduced growth of seedlings planted in the fill material [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Wolf E, Cooper D: Restoration of Geomorphic Structure, Hydrologic Regime, and Vegetation in Upper Halstead Meadow.

It is clear from the literature on restoration of other types of ecosystems that variations in project design, quality of construction, choice of planting material, level of training and supervision of the personnel implementing the project, and many other variables associated with project implementation can have a large effect on the results e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Kusler JA, Kentula ME: Wetland Creation and Restoration: Status of the Science.

The two main effects of this type of variation are damage to projects caused by major events such as large storms/floods e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Wolf E, Cooper D: Restoration of Geomorphic Structure, Hydrologic Regime, and Vegetation in Upper Halstead Meadow.

Our review would have been stronger if the effectiveness of more wet meadow projects had been investigated over the years or, in cases where they were investigated, if the results had been made more widely available. Although speculative, we suspect that the results of projects that failed are less likely to have been published, and yet much can be learned from failed projects. Also, if most failed projects were not reported in accessible formats, then our results may be biased by a tendency to report more frequently on successful projects. None of the articles we found reported a total failure to achieve the stated objectives, although one reported on damage that may have resulted in failure if it hadn’t been effectively repaired [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Wolf E, Cooper D: Restoration of Geomorphic Structure, Hydrologic Regime, and Vegetation in Upper Halstead Meadow.

In particular, a search strategy that encompassed more completely the literature on grazing management in riparian areas e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Elmore W, Kaufmann B: Riparian and watershed systems: degradation and restoration.

We also recognize that important work has been done on wet meadow restoration in other regions, much of which could be relevant to restoration efforts in the American Southwest.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30">Reviewers’ conclusions</h3><p>While much of the evidence is not of the highest quality and therefore considerable caution is warranted, it is nevertheless apparent that progress has been made over the past 20 years in wet meadow restoration. In particular, especially important contributions have been made in restoring the highly degraded wet meadow systems that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively straight gullies. There is substantial evidence that the pond-and-plug approach, which was first implemented approximately 15 years ago, is an effective technique for restoring most aspects of these systems, albeit at the cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not necessarily natural features of wet meadows.</p><p>Important lessons continue to be learned about wet meadow restoration practices, including those aimed at establishing suitable floodplain and stream channel morphology, a more natural hydrologic regime, and more effective revegetation. The damage that continues to plague many projects, such as erosion and structure damage caused by floods, demonstrates that we still have much to learn about project design and implementation. It also suggests we have to recognize that post-project vigilance and a commitment to ongoing maintenance will be needed to ensure long-term success.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31">Implications for management</h3><p>One of the most important implications for managers is that not enough information on the projects carried out to date has been documented and shared. During the course of this review, we encountered several projects in the field or on websites for which no substantive documentation of any kind could be located; we expect that this is common throughout the region. Many opportunities to learn both from successes and failures have undoubtedly been lost over the years due to this failure to document projects and to make the information widely available. Making more project information available through websites can be a powerful tool. The Feather River Coordinated Resource Management group’s website (<a href="http://www.feather-river-crm.org/">http://www.feather-river-crm.org/</a>) is perhaps the best example in the region of this approach to sharing information on wet meadow restoration.</p><p>We understand that there are serious constraints on managers’ time and resources, but allocating additional effort to project documentation, including more formal and longer-lasting monitoring programs, is an important need that should be addressed. One approach that might help in this regard is for practitioners to work with scientists from government agencies, local universities and colleges, and other organizations. When this type of collaboration has happened in the past it appears to have been effective e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Szewczak JM: Bats of Carman Valley, Report 1997–2004 Survey and Monitoring.

We have developed a list of research questions that would be worthwhile to address. While many of these have been investigated to some degree already, there is much more to learn. Although they are listed within each section in order of priority from our perspective, we realize that research priorities may vary depending on the predominant types of disturbance being addressed within a given area, as well as the management priorities of government agencies and other landowners.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec33">Geomorphology and Hydrology</h4><p>• How do the pond-and-plug technique, re-channelization, and smaller-scale channel restoration techniques perform in the long-term, especially in terms of stream channel/floodplain stability?</p><p>• How can we improve upon current practices to make them more resistant or resilient to disturbances such as flooding?</p><p>• It would be valuable to investigate the impact and development of created ponds (when using the pond-and-plug technique) more than has been done to date – what impact do they have on meadow hydrology and do they show signs of filling in over time?</p><p>• How do individual restoration projects affect water storage, streamflow and water supplies downstream?

Dick Fleishman of the United States Forest Service, Coconino National Forest helped keep us inspired by taking us on several field trips of local wet meadow restoration projects. The feedback from Jonathan Long of the Pacific Southwest Research Station has been invaluable. Jonathon also helped us get in contact with several other people involved in wet meadow restoration. We would like to thank all the practitioners and researchers who participated in a survey that was helpful in looking at the different benefits and disadvantages of individual restoration techniques. Some of them also provided us with literature for this review. Finally, we would like to thank Liz Kalies, of the Ecological Restoration Institute, as well as two anonymous reviewers and the <i>Environmental Evidence</i> editorial staff, for their guidance and comments on earlier drafts of this review.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="author-information"><div class="c-article-section" id="author-information-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="author-information">Author information</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="author-information-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="affiliations">Affiliations</h3><ol class="c-article-author-affiliation__list"><li id="Aff1"><p class="c-article-author-affiliation__address">School of Forestry, Northern Arizona University, P.O.
