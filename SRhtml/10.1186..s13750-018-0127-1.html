        <title>To what extent do mesophotic coral ecosystems and shallow reefs share species of conservation interest? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Globally, shallow-water coral reef biodiversity is at risk from a variety of threats, some of which may attenuate with depth. Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), occurring from 30 to 40&#160;m and deeper in tropical locations, have been subject to a surge of research this century. Though a number of valuable narrative reviews exist, a systematic quantitative synthesis of published MCE studies is lacking. We conducted a systematic review to collate mesophotic research, including studies from the twentieth century to the present. We highlight current biases in research effort, regarding locations and subject matter, and suggest where more attention may be particularly valuable. Following a notable number of studies considering the potential for mesophotic reefs to act as refuges, it is important to know how comprehensive these sources of recruits and organisms capable of moving to shallow water reefs may be. We search seven sources of bibliographic data with two search strings, as well as personal libraries. Articles were included if they contained species presence data from both shallower and deeper than 30&#160;m depth on tropical coral reefs. Studies were critically appraised based on the number of species identified and balanced sampling effort with depth. Maximum and minimum depths per species were extracted from each study, along with study region and taxon. We quantified the degree of community overlap between shallow tropical reefs (&lt;&#8201;30&#160;m) and reefs surveyed at the same locations below 30&#160;m. Proportions of shallow species, across all studied taxa, observed deeper than 30&#160;m were used to generate log odds ratios and passed to a mixed-effects model. Study location and taxon were included as effect modifiers. Funnel plots, regression tests, fail safe numbers, and analysis of a high validity subgroup contributed to sensitivity analyses and tests of bias. Across all studies synthesised we found two-thirds of shallow species were present on mesophotic reefs. Further analysis by taxon and broad locations show that this pattern is influenced geographically and taxonomically. Community overlap was estimated as low as 26% and as high as 97% for some cases. There is clear support for the hypothesis that protecting mesophotic reefs will also help to conserve shallow water species. At the same time, it is important to note that this study does not address mesophotic-specialist communities, or the ecological forces which would permit refuge dynamics. As we limit our analysis to species only present above 30&#160;m it is also possible diversity found exclusively deeper than 30&#160;m warrants protection in its own right. Further research into relatively ignored taxa and geographic regions will help improve the design of protected areas in future."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="To what extent do mesophotic coral ecosystems and shallow reefs share species of conservation interest? A systematic review"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="Globally, shallow-water coral reef biodiversity is at risk from a variety of threats, some of which may attenuate with depth. Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), occurring from 30 to 40&amp;nbsp;m and deeper in tropical locations, have been subject to a surge of research this century. Though a number of valuable narrative reviews exist, a systematic quantitative synthesis of published MCE studies is lacking. We conducted a systematic review to collate mesophotic research, including studies from the twentieth century to the present. We highlight current biases in research effort, regarding locations and subject matter, and suggest where more attention may be particularly valuable. Following a notable number of studies considering the potential for mesophotic reefs to act as refuges, it is important to know how comprehensive these sources of recruits and organisms capable of moving to shallow water reefs may be. We search seven sources of bibliographic data with two search strings, as well as personal libraries. Articles were included if they contained species presence data from both shallower and deeper than 30&amp;nbsp;m depth on tropical coral reefs. Studies were critically appraised based on the number of species identified and balanced sampling effort with depth. Maximum and minimum depths per species were extracted from each study, along with study region and taxon. We quantified the degree of community overlap between shallow tropical reefs (&amp;lt; 30&amp;nbsp;m) and reefs surveyed at the same locations below 30&amp;nbsp;m. Proportions of shallow species, across all studied taxa, observed deeper than 30&amp;nbsp;m were used to generate log odds ratios and passed to a mixed-effects model. Study location and taxon were included as effect modifiers. Funnel plots, regression tests, fail safe numbers, and analysis of a high validity subgroup contributed to sensitivity analyses and tests of bias. Across all studies synthesised we found two-thirds of shallow species were present on mesophotic reefs. Further analysis by taxon and broad locations show that this pattern is influenced geographically and taxonomically. Community overlap was estimated as low as 26% and as high as 97% for some cases. There is clear support for the hypothesis that protecting mesophotic reefs will also help to conserve shallow water species. At the same time, it is important to note that this study does not address mesophotic-specialist communities, or the ecological forces which would permit refuge dynamics. As we limit our analysis to species only present above 30&amp;nbsp;m it is also possible diversity found exclusively deeper than 30&amp;nbsp;m warrants protection in its own right. Further research into relatively ignored taxa and geographic regions will help improve the design of protected areas in future."/>

Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs), occurring from 30 to 40 m and deeper in tropical locations, have been subject to a surge of research this century. Though a number of valuable narrative reviews exist, a systematic quantitative synthesis of published MCE studies is lacking. We conducted a systematic review to collate mesophotic research, including studies from the twentieth century to the present. We highlight current biases in research effort, regarding locations and subject matter, and suggest where more attention may be particularly valuable. Following a notable number of studies considering the potential for mesophotic reefs to act as refuges, it is important to know how comprehensive these sources of recruits and organisms capable of moving to shallow water reefs may be.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>We search seven sources of bibliographic data with two search strings, as well as personal libraries. Articles were included if they contained species presence data from both shallower and deeper than 30 m depth on tropical coral reefs. Studies were critically appraised based on the number of species identified and balanced sampling effort with depth. Maximum and minimum depths per species were extracted from each study, along with study region and taxon. We quantified the degree of community overlap between shallow tropical reefs (&lt; 30 m) and reefs surveyed at the same locations below 30 m. Proportions of shallow species, across all studied taxa, observed deeper than 30 m were used to generate log odds ratios and passed to a mixed-effects model. Study location and taxon were included as effect modifiers. Funnel plots, regression tests, fail safe numbers, and analysis of a high validity subgroup contributed to sensitivity analyses and tests of bias.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Across all studies synthesised we found two-thirds of shallow species were present on mesophotic reefs. Further analysis by taxon and broad locations show that this pattern is influenced geographically and taxonomically. Community overlap was estimated as low as 26% and as high as 97% for some cases.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>There is clear support for the hypothesis that protecting mesophotic reefs will also help to conserve shallow water species. At the same time, it is important to note that this study does not address mesophotic-specialist communities, or the ecological forces which would permit refuge dynamics. As we limit our analysis to species only present above 30 m it is also possible diversity found exclusively deeper than 30 m warrants protection in its own right. Further research into relatively ignored taxa and geographic regions will help improve the design of protected areas in future.</p></div></div></section>

The screening was conducted by authors who had no publications in the list screened, preventing bias in the inclusion of data.</p><p>The original screening and validity appraisal criteria were reviewed to reconcile disagreements during Kappa analysis, at each level of screening, between the two reviewers. 1000 articles were coded by both reviewers at title and abstract level, 50 full texts were coded by both reviewers. Any differently assigned articles were discussed.

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Critical appraisal</h3><p>External validity considers the generalisability, and the fairness of comparison between different studies. Internal validity considers the risk of bias within a specific study. A number of methods exist to critically assess these concepts, but most are developed with randomised control trials in mind, or at least observational studies with a level of randomisation in allocation and blinding rarely found outside of the medical sciences [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Bilotta GS, Milner AM, Boyd IL.

To what extent do mesophotic coral ecosystems and shallow reefs share species of conservation interest? Environ Evid. 2016;5:16. &#xA;https://doi.org/10.1186/s13750-016-0068-5&#xA;&#xA;." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#ref-CR29" id="ref-link-section-d21698e1090">29</a>]. By including geographical area and taxon as effect modifiers, we have controlled for the primary confounding sources of variability when comparing studies. We therefore consider the spatial scales of different studies are the primary remaining threat to external validity. A key based on a whole ocean region is likely to find a greater depth range for a given species than a study at a specific location, because the key is likely based on data from a broader range of abiotic conditions.</p><p>With respect to internal validity, our primary concern with mesophotic research is that sampling effort may decline with increasing depth. This can lead to an underestimate of the number of species present deeper than 30 m as rarer species are found in shallow water, but are missed at depth. Similarly, studies reporting only a small number of species may provide a less reliable estimate of community level overlap. This is because the importance of a single species depth range is elevated, when community overlap is calculated as a proportion. Our critical appraisal is therefore based on the following criteria:</p><p>Validity appraisal criteria:</p><ol class="u-list-style-none"><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">1.</span><p>More than 10 species are identified within a taxon.</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">2.</span><p>The study is not a regional taxonomic key.</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">3.</span><p>Even sampling effort is reported across depths.</p></li></ol>
<p>Studies passing all these criteria were included in a high validity sub-group for sensitivity analysis. We choose to limit our high validity group to studies with more than ten species to avoid undue influence of single species over community level overlap values.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Data extraction</h3><p>Maximum and minimum depths for each species reported in an article were extracted manually. A subset of 12 articles were checked for consistency of data extraction by a second reviewer. Discussion of these extractions produced the following clarifications. Depth ranges for adults and juveniles of a species were combined into a single depth range. For the purposes of defining multiple studies within an article, locations were considered different when across multiple countries, when provided. Australia and the USA were exceptions because of their size, here we took into account the seas around Australia, and the islands/coastlines sampled of the USA. The review was conducted by authors who had no publications in the list screened at full text, preventing bias in the inclusion of data. Data were restricted to species occurring on tropical and sub-tropical reefs when multiple habitats were studied in a single article, such as mangroves and reefs. If these data were not available, the corresponding author was contacted. Contact was attempted twice before asking members of the advisory committee to try a third time with any researchers they knew personally. Failure to respond to these contact attempts led to exclusion of the data set from the analysis (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#MOESM2">2</a>).

<p>After more than half a century of research, the mesophotic field is still largely descriptive and focussed on pattern. This is supported by the majority of studies being assigned an ecology tag during our screening process (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#Fig2">2</a>b). The next most common tag was assigned six times less frequently and indicates articles considering disturbance or damage on mesophotic reefs. Other common MCE study types refer to trophic interactions, symbioses, and reproduction.</p><p>This exercise was used as an opportunity to see how researchers define mesophotic reefs. 27% of articles include a depth limit in their introductions. The overwhelming majority of papers providing a definition state MCEs start at 30 m depth (89%), however, some papers exist claiming the upper bound is 20 m or even as deep as 60 m.</p><p>Mesophotic reefs in the western Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, are the focus of most published studies, followed by those on archipelagos in the Pacific (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#Fig2">2</a>d). Australian reefs represent another hot spot of activity, but are nonetheless not as well studied. The Red Sea has provided a relatively large number of articles for its area, while the Indian Ocean has been comparatively understudied.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec15">Data-synthesis</h3><p>Across the whole dataset, the median proportion of shallow species also present below 30 m is 0.67. The meta-analysis was performed on articles assigned as Eco at abstract level screening, and subsequently passed full-text level screening, as well as two further publications provided as titles at the review stage. Of these 81 + 2 articles (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#Fig1">1</a>), data were successfully extracted from 35, yielding 52 studies (combinations of broad taxon and locations within articles) after contacting corresponding authors (Additional files <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#MOESM2">2</a>).

The central Pacific has the highest community overlap between shallow and mesophotic reefs at 72% (95% CI 53–85%). Studies off the cost of Brazil report the lowest at 30% (7–72%) when ignoring areas represented by a single study. For taxa, models of algal groups all returned predictions of over 75% overlap. 86% (37–98%) of shallow-water Antipatharia were found on mesophotic reefs, while octocorals were predicted to have the lowest overlap of all factor levels at 38% (15–68%). The amount of studies retrieved for a given factor level does influence the width of the confidence interval. Scleractinia with 18 studies has a prediction ranging by 29%, whereas Octocorallia with three studies ranges by 53%. Data underlying the figure can be found in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#MOESM8">8</a>.</p><p>As part of the sensitivity analysis 22 studies were excluded from the high validity group, following our validity appraisal criteria. The analysis was then re-run to quantify the influence of these studies over our synthesis (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#Fig4">4</a>).

The dataset-wide estimate of community overlap dropped by 10 percentage points to 0.57. No change in broad pattern is noted, only a slight increase in the range of predictions, and a slight decrease in estimated overlap. We would generally expect a high validity sub-group analysis to narrow the prediction intervals. Our results suggest that the overriding influence may be the reduction in sample size, and that studies outside of the high validity group are largely similar to those retained. This is despite low validity studies operating at larger spatial scales and with unbalanced sampling effort with depth. A regression test provides no evidence for publication bias in the dataset (<i>t</i> = 0.5382, <i>df</i> = 33, <i>P</i> = 0.594), also visualised with a funnel plot (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#MOESM9">9</a>).

<p>As individual studies would lead us to expect, community overlap varies by region (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#Fig4">4</a>, Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#MOESM8">8</a>). The highest proportion of shallow species present on mesophotic reefs was predicted for the central Pacific at 72% (95% CI 53–85%). Brazilian reefs and the Coral Sea with the Great Barrier Reef both harbour less than half of shallow reef taxa on MCEs at 31% (7–72%) and 41% (20–65%) respectively.

This is likely underpinned by abiotic factors interacting with species physiology. The current use of an arbitrary 30 m depth limit, derived from recreational SCUBA limitations, may be limiting our ability to accurately report on ecological pattern. If the transition depth occurs deeper, a larger portion of shallow water species will be present below 30 m.

The two taxonomic groups with the largest number of studies contributing to the synthesis, fish and Scleractinia, are estimated as having 64% (46–79%) and 57% (42–71%) of shallow taxa on MCEs respectively. These values are relatively close to our synthesis-wide estimate. Other taxonomic groups have relatively large confidence intervals, but all three algal taxa return high community overlap of over 75%. This may be surprising for autotrophic taxa, but it appears a 30 m boundary is within the physiological envelope of most algal species identified. The high estimate of 86% (37–98%) for Antipatharia, though unintuitive for a taxon traditionally considered ‘deep’ [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Cairns SD.

For the most part, if a black coral is observed shallower than 30 m it is likely a deep species encroaching on shallow reefs. Alternatively, a small number of species may have evolved towards shallow-water emergence. The smaller number of species contributing to estimates for taxa other than fish and Scleractinia highlights the need for taxonomic diversity in future mesophotic studies.

This is to some extent unavoidable because of the locations of research groups in developed countries near accessible reefs (i.e., Hawai’i, US Virgin Islands, and Israel among others). We confirm the bias towards studies in the central Pacific and western Atlantic region. A better global understanding of MCEs requires increased research attention in the Coral Triangle and the wider Indian Ocean to the west. Currently MCE research attention focuses on reefs with lower coral species richness [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 76" title="Veron JEN.

Though this may be convenient for a number of reasons, it may mean ecological differences between shallow and mesophotic reefs resulting from greater competition and niche diversification are missed.</p><p>In addition to geographic biases, the mesophotic field lacks diversity in terms of study types. As expected for a field which has only recently taken off (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0127-1#Fig2">2</a>a), a large proportion of the studies focus on ecological description.

Though the overwhelming majority of papers define mesophotic reefs as starting at 30 m, the mesophotic research strategy more loosely states they can start from 30 to 40 m [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Puglise KA, Hinderstein LM, Marr JCA, Dowgiallo MJ, Martinez FA. 2009.

Not surprisingly the next most common definition is for mesophotic communities starting at 40 m. More interestingly, six papers within the last 10 years define MCEs from 50 m with another one at 20 m and one at 60 m. As the number of papers on mesophotic reefs increases it is important to remain consistent in the application of terminology, or specify explicitly how these boundaries may be recognised to vary.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec19">Reasons for heterogeneity</h4><p>Our analysis returns an <i>I</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> of 72.3%, under Cochrane review guidelines this can be interpreted as ‘substantial’ unexplained heterogeneity [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Higgins JP, Green S.

Adopting a presence-absence approach does, however, miss the importance of population density. Our analysis could have been influenced by population over-spill where a few out-lying individuals from an otherwise shallow species were observed deeper than 30 m (Bongaerts, under review). The refuge dynamics which may occur on MCEs must be underpinned by reproductively active source populations, rather than the sinks represented by outlier observations as hypothesised in deep-sea ecosystems [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 86" title="Rex MA, McClain CR, Johnson NA, Etter RJ, Allen JA, Bouchet P, et al.

The effect sizes of depth as log odds ratios of the total shallow species pool compared to shallow species present deeper than 30 m, of the 52 included studies are displayed. Studies are in the same order as in Additional file 3. Dots indicate the effect size estimate and are scaled to the number of species observed within each study. The black lines extend from the lower to upper 95% confidence limit of each study estimate. Orange lines are for reference to help interpretation. The dashed line at 0 indicates the effect size of studies finding 50% community overlap. The solid lines indicate the effect size of the largest study reporting 0% overlap (negative effect size) and 100% (positive effect size). Note that due to the scaling of effect sizes the confidence intervals become asymmetrical when back transformed to proportions (Fig. 4).</a></h3></div><div class="c-article-supplementary__item" data-test="supp-item" id="MOESM8"><h3 class="c-article-supplementary__title u-h3"><a class="print-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view supplementary info" data-track-label="link" data-test="supp-info-link" href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-018-0127-1/MediaObjects/13750_2018_127_MOESM8_ESM.docx" data-supp-info-image=""><b>Additional file 8.</b> Factor level effects.

The proportion of all species reported, found exclusively deeper than 30 m, increases with the maximum depth of a study. An absence of deep sampling efforts does not allow us to claim there are low levels of MCE specific biodiversity. As such we limit the discussion in this paper to the shallow taxa occurring on MCEs, not of the total change in community between the two depth zones. In order for a fair comparison to be made between shallow and mesophotic biodiversity we must more strictly define the lower limit of MCEs. Data was limited to studies reporting a maximum depth &lt; 500 m for legibility.</a></h3></div></div></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="rightslink"><div class="c-article-section" id="rightslink-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="rightslink">Rights and permissions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="rightslink-content">
