        <title>What spatially explicit quantitative evidence exists that shows the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa? A systematic map protocol | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Over the last two decades there has been an increase in the demand for land in Sub Saharan Africa, particularly from foreign agribusiness investment to provide food for an increasing human population. The majority of land outside of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa is under customary tenure. Due to poor land administration in the region, communities living in undocumented land areas tend to be at greater risk of eviction from increasing liberalisation of land markets. To prevent local displacement and disturbance to investment caused by land disputes tenure clarification is growing in importance on national and international agendas. Land conversion can fragment wildlife habitat while reducing the suitable range areas of terrestrial mammal populations on the continent. Simultaneously illegal hunting is on the rise for a wide variety of taxa driven by a demand for food and income from the sale of animal products. To enable a better understanding of how land tenure arrangements impact upon spatial variations in illegal hunting, this protocol sets out the parameters for an evidence map which will collate and analyse the spatially explicit quantitative evidence that exists showing the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of focus as it contains the highest number of terrestrial mammals listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taking stock of what methods have been used to gather data and where evidence exists can guide future research in this area while informing conservation interventions. This evidence map will compare: (1) data availability on the spatial distribution of illicit hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals across different land tenure regimes in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) research methodologies that have primarily been used to collect quantitative data on illegal hunting and comparability of existing data; (3) preferences in the research body toward particular taxa and geographical areas, (4) the evidence map will provide an analysis on the influence other environmental and anthropogenic determinants that influence the spatial distribution of illicit hunting incidences, e.g., proximity to roads, water bodies, range patrol bases etc. Eight academic databases and numerous organisation repositories will be searched for relevant studies by three authors. Double screening will be carried out on all articles to locate studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria, for inclusion studies must contain spatially explicit quantitative data on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Relevant information from studies will be extracted to a custom-made extraction form. The resulting map will consist of a narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and a heat map in the form of a matrix. By providing an overview of the evidence base the resulting map can inform future meta-analyses by showing where there is sufficient comparable data while guiding conservation interventions by indicating geographical areas where species are most at risk."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Over the last two decades there has been an increase in the demand for land in Sub Saharan Africa, particularly from foreign agribusiness investment to provide food for an increasing human population. The majority of land outside of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa is under customary tenure. Due to poor land administration in the region, communities living in undocumented land areas tend to be at greater risk of eviction from increasing liberalisation of land markets. To prevent local displacement and disturbance to investment caused by land disputes tenure clarification is growing in importance on national and international agendas. Land conversion can fragment wildlife habitat while reducing the suitable range areas of terrestrial mammal populations on the continent. Simultaneously illegal hunting is on the rise for a wide variety of taxa driven by a demand for food and income from the sale of animal products. To enable a better understanding of how land tenure arrangements impact upon spatial variations in illegal hunting, this protocol sets out the parameters for an evidence map which will collate and analyse the spatially explicit quantitative evidence that exists showing the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of focus as it contains the highest number of terrestrial mammals listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taking stock of what methods have been used to gather data and where evidence exists can guide future research in this area while informing conservation interventions. This evidence map will compare: (1) data availability on the spatial distribution of illicit hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals across different land tenure regimes in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) research methodologies that have primarily been used to collect quantitative data on illegal hunting and comparability of existing data; (3) preferences in the research body toward particular taxa and geographical areas, (4) the evidence map will provide an analysis on the influence other environmental and anthropogenic determinants that influence the spatial distribution of illicit hunting incidences, e.g., proximity to roads, water bodies, range patrol bases etc. Eight academic databases and numerous organisation repositories will be searched for relevant studies by three authors. Double screening will be carried out on all articles to locate studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria, for inclusion studies must contain spatially explicit quantitative data on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Relevant information from studies will be extracted to a custom-made extraction form. The resulting map will consist of a narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and a heat map in the form of a matrix. By providing an overview of the evidence base the resulting map can inform future meta-analyses by showing where there is sufficient comparable data while guiding conservation interventions by indicating geographical areas where species are most at risk."/>

The majority of land outside of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa is under customary tenure. Due to poor land administration in the region, communities living in undocumented land areas tend to be at greater risk of eviction from increasing liberalisation of land markets. To prevent local displacement and disturbance to investment caused by land disputes tenure clarification is growing in importance on national and international agendas. Land conversion can fragment wildlife habitat while reducing the suitable range areas of terrestrial mammal populations on the continent. Simultaneously illegal hunting is on the rise for a wide variety of taxa driven by a demand for food and income from the sale of animal products. To enable a better understanding of how land tenure arrangements impact upon spatial variations in illegal hunting, this protocol sets out the parameters for an evidence map which will collate and analyse the spatially explicit quantitative evidence that exists showing the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of focus as it contains the highest number of terrestrial mammals listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Taking stock of what methods have been used to gather data and where evidence exists can guide future research in this area while informing conservation interventions.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>This evidence map will compare: (1) data availability on the spatial distribution of illicit hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals across different land tenure regimes in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) research methodologies that have primarily been used to collect quantitative data on illegal hunting and comparability of existing data; (3) preferences in the research body toward particular taxa and geographical areas, (4) the evidence map will provide an analysis on the influence other environmental and anthropogenic determinants that influence the spatial distribution of illicit hunting incidences, e.g., proximity to roads, water bodies, range patrol bases etc. Eight academic databases and numerous organisation repositories will be searched for relevant studies by three authors. Double screening will be carried out on all articles to locate studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria, for inclusion studies must contain spatially explicit quantitative data on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Relevant information from studies will be extracted to a custom-made extraction form. The resulting map will consist of a narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and a heat map in the form of a matrix. By providing an overview of the evidence base the resulting map can inform future meta-analyses by showing where there is sufficient comparable data while guiding conservation interventions by indicating geographical areas where species are most at risk.</p></div></div></section>

The boundaries of these areas were largely dependent on topographical features such as ridge lines and waterways and the locations of these protected area networks remain largely intact today.

The legal distinction between hunting using firearms and traditional hunting methods was introduced in Kenya in 1928 and the use of snares was made illegal in Southern Rhodesia in 1938.

In many countries communities can be found living informally within protected area networks. While colonialism radically altered land tenure and wildlife management arrangements, national land acts since independence have further diversified the systems by which land can be occupied and owned. The optimal arrangements for sustainable wildlife management and land governance remains heavily contested and there is a rich body of literature discussing this topic. In particular, the work of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom who demonstrated that widely held assumptions that common pool resource management causes degradation, propagated by Hardin’s thesis on the tragedy of the commons, does not hold up to scrutiny [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Ostrom E.

While these two markets have very different cultural and socio-economic drivers, the impact of the kill on population dynamics is the same. The harvest of wild meat for subsistence purposes is permitted in some countries under a quota system and is commonly referred to as ‘game meat’, whereas illegally harvested wild meat is termed ‘bushmeat’. The evidence map this protocol outlines is concerned with the spatial distribution of incidences of illegal hunting and the quantitative methods used to collect data. While mortality levels of endangered terrestrial mammals are impacted by a multitude of factors including zoonotic disease, loss of prey, habitat fragmentation, casualties on transport corridors, war and pollution, etc., the resulting map is only concerned with the threat of illegal hunting.</p><p>This topic is suitable for an evidence map as there is a wide diversity of taxa that has been studied over a variety of geographical areas using disparate methodologies. It is not known from existing literature whether there is sufficient comparable data to conduct a full systematic review. By generating an understanding of the quality and quantity of evidence across various species, countries and land management areas research gluts and gaps can be identified for future review while highlighting emergent trends in the evidence base. Illicit activities are by their nature difficult to document. One commonly employed method is interviewing hunters or hunting follows which are used to quantify offtake while providing the location of capture sites. This requires strong rapport to be built so that hunters trust that data will not be used to reprimand them [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Golden CD.

Another common method is recording carcass locations where the cause of death is identified as hunting and monitoring the location and distribution of cartridges, snares, drives and traps. While interviews and surveys with hunters, households or bushmeat market sellers provide an insight into how much meat is consumed or sold these methods often do not provide accurate data on capture locations unless collected via hunter recall. The number of bushmeat studies has increased over the last two decades, increasing the quantity of data. However, comparing capture over different spatiotemporal scales remains challenging due to differing research methodologies and a lack of longitudinal studies [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="van Velden J, Wilson K, Biggs D.

One long-term global dataset that exists showing the spatiotemporal distribution of illegal poaching incidences is the monitoring the illegal killing of elephants (MIKE) programme, compiled by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This programme has compiled data on elephant mortality levels since 2001 collected by national wildlife authorities; carcasses found in the designated MIKE sites are recorded with the suspected cause of death. The proportion of illegally killed elephants (PIKE) is then calculated allowing for spatiotemporal comparisons. This globally co-ordinated dataset on the location of poaching incidences is unique and does not exist for any other endangered species at the same scale. While most species listed in the endangered categories by IUCN have the majority of their range in protected areas, this is not the case for all species, e.g., cheetah [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Marker LL, Boast LK.

The kind of wildlife user rights that exist in different land areas largely depends on how land is owned and managed which varies considerably between countries. Hunting regulations are commonly stipulated in national wildlife and land acts with wildlife considered either ‘res nullius’ (without ownership), or under the regulation and control of the state, private entity or community [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Lindsey PA, Balme G, Becker M, Begg C, Bento C, Bocchino C, et al.

In some countries subsistence hunting is allowed without a permit (e.g., Angola, Malawi and Mozambique) while in other countries acquisition of a permit allows subsistence and trophy hunting in certain areas of land. Illegal hunting occurs due to a number of drivers including local and international demand for animal derived products, e.g. food, medicine, jewellery, clothing. Another key driver of species decline is from retaliatory killing by farmers who have lost livestock from carnivore predation or whose crops have been raided by elephants. The latter driver is a result of increased occupation of land from a rising human population which reduces the space wild mammals have to roam without encroaching on community land. Several studies have found that proximity to human settlements, markets and roads correlate with areas of high offtake as these variables allow hunters to transport illegal harvests speedily to a point of sale [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Hofer HC, East M, Huish S.

If there are enough studies comparing similar variables, findings could be used to construct weights in geospatial models that seek to assess the probability of hunting occurring in certain locations.</p><p>The resulting map will be displayed as a matrix showing how studies relate to the different criteria outlined under population, exposure and outcome. There is a huge variety of taxa that is under threat from illegal hunting, this map will show how the distribution of research varies across species, geographical areas and according to different hunting drivers. The main methods employed to collect data will be documented, e.g., observing snaring patterns, hunting follows, bushmeat market surveys while also documenting who has mainly been responsible for collecting data, e.g., communities, law enforcement agencies, academic researchers. The outcome of studies will be synthesised to show any detectable trends in terms of how hunting varies across tenure sites or on a gradient around one site, e.g. from the border of a protected area. An understanding of the spatial distribution of illegal hunting can be used to identify high-risk areas and guide conservation actors on where it would be most beneficial to locate wildlife ranger posts. The map will determine whether the impact of illegal hunting varies across land tenure sites and what evidence is available to support claims that one tenure arrangement, e.g. CBRNM is more effective at sustainable wildlife management compared with others.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec6"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec6-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec6">Primary question</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec6-content"><p>What spatially explicit quantitative evidence exists that shows the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa?</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Population</h3><p>Endangered terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa categorised as vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and for whom human hunting and trapping is listed as a threat.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec8">Exposure</h3><p>Tenure arrangements on the land where the above population resides, e.g. protected area, customary land, community conservancy etc.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Comparator</h3><p>The comparator will be between study sites where the land tenure varies, e.g. protected vs partially protected area (spatial comparator).

The focus is only on incidences of mortality caused by illegal human hunting and not from zoonotic disease or other anthropogenic causes. The study must include the geographical location of the kill site(s).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Exclusion criteria</h3><p>Studies that are purely demographic and have collected data on species abundance and distribution and only mention illegal hunting as a threat without collecting data on occurrence will be excluded. Similarly studies that have only collected data on species behavior in response to perceived threats, e.g., flight initiation distance will be excluded. Studies that infer the level of illegal hunting by providing proxies, e.g., bushmeat price as an indicator of supply will not be included. The location of the kill sites must be included as primary data and not referenced from other studies. The focus is on unregulated illegal hunting hence studies on trophy hunts are excluded as this is a regulated form of hunting where the government sets quotas taking into account local population dynamics, if species are hunted in trophy hunting concession off quota, i.e. illegally these will be included. All articles that are excluded at full text will be recorded with a description of the focus of the article and the reason for exclusion.</p><p>We will exclude the following kinds of articles:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22">Data coding strategy</h3><p>We will use a bespoke, standard data extraction form to extract descriptive data from all studies meeting our inclusion criteria (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0139-x#MOESM3">3</a>). Data extracted will include bibliographic details, information on the study context including: type of land tenure site included in study, country(s), region and/or district, size of study area surveyed and a list of the species included in the study that are in the relevant population criteria outlined above. Information on study design will be collected including data collection method, unit of analysis used, e.g., village or market and the size of the area surveyed. Who funded and conducted the study will be recorded and whether the organisation(s) is sub-national, national or international. Whether any of the authors are registered at an organisation in the country of data collection will be recorded. As an evidence map the comprehensiveness of the data coding strategy is vital, all data that will be extracted can be found in the data extraction form (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0139-x#MOESM3">3</a>). When designing the data extraction form a subset of 20 studies were screened to ensure clarity and ease of use. To ensure the data extraction form is used consistently between reviewers a subset of 20% of articles that are included after full text screening will be double coded to check the same data is being extracted, any discrepancies will be discussed and the extraction form will be altered accordingly. At both the level of abstract and title screening and full text a kappa statistic will be generated. To be included in the evidence map only studies that meet the criteria outlined above will be included. All articles screened at full text that are excluded will be recorded with the reason as to why they are excluded.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23">Study mapping and presentation</h3><p>The output will be a systematic map published in this journal with the data presented as descriptive statistics and through a matrix to show corresponding findings between the different elements of the inclusion criteria. Findings on the frequency and intensity of hunting across different land tenure areas will be analysed with a detailed description of how this evidence varies across taxa and regions. The impact of hunting incidences in relation to other variables including proximity to roads, water bodies and urban settlements will be recorded to tentatively show whether any trends emerge across studies. We will provide a narrative synthesis discussing the range of methods used to collect data on illegal hunting and any methodological challenges in harmonising findings. The authors of this protocol have not authored any articles that are eligible to be included in the review.</p></div></div></section>
