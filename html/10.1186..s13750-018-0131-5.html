        <title>What is the effect of prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forest on biodiversity, beyond pyrophilous and saproxylic species? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="While the effects of prescribed burning on tree regeneration and on pyrophilous and/or saproxylic species are relatively well known, effects on other organisms are less clear. The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention&#160;were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of&#160;pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified. Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets. Prescribed burning may have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent and careful planning is needed."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="What is the effect of prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forest on biodiversity, beyond pyrophilous and saproxylic species? A systematic review"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="While the effects of prescribed burning on tree regeneration and on pyrophilous and/or saproxylic species are relatively well known, effects on other organisms are less clear. The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention&amp;nbsp;were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of&amp;nbsp;pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified. Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets. Prescribed burning may have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent and careful planning is needed."/>

The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify how biodiversity is affected by prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forests, and whether burning may be useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity, beyond that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>The review examined primary field studies of the effects of prescribed burning on biodiversity in boreal and temperate forests in protected areas or under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternate levels of intervention were comparators. Relevant outcomes were species richness and diversity, excluding that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Relevant studies were extracted from a recent systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. Additional searches and a search update were undertaken using a strategy targeted to identify studies focused on prescribed burning interventions. Grey literature and bibliographies of relevant published reviews were also searched for evidence. Studies were assessed for internal and external validity and data were extracted, using validity assessment and data extraction tools specifically designed for this review. Studies were presented in a narrative synthesis and interactive map, and those which were suitable were quantitatively synthesised using meta-analyses, subgroup analysis and meta-regression.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Searches generated a total of 12,971 unique records. After screening for relevance, 244 studies (from 235 articles) were included in this review. Most studied forests were located in the USA (172/244), with the rest located in Canada, Europe and Australia. Eighty-two studies reporting 219 comparisons were included in the quantitative synthesis. Within the meta-analyses for each group of taxa, we identified a small to moderate volume of evidence, and heterogeneity was ubiquitous. Prescribed burning had significant positive effects on vascular plant richness, non-native vascular plant richness, and in broadleaf forests, herbaceous plant richness. Time since the burn, forest type and climate zone were significant moderators predicting the effect of burning on herbaceous plant richness. No other significant relationships were identified.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>Knowledge gaps exist for studies outside North America, in mixed forests and for non-plant organism outcomes. We identify a need to apply study designs consistently and appropriately, minimising the impact of confounding factors wherever possible, and to provide extensive detail in study reports. We recommend that researchers build long-term datasets charting the impacts of prescribed burning on succession. The lack of consistent findings was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators, and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. Rather than making any general recommendations on the use of prescribed burning for biodiversity restoration, we provide an evidence atlas of previous studies for researchers and practitioners to use. We observe that outcomes are still difficult to predict, and any restoration project should include a component of monitoring to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve conservation targets. Prescribed burning may have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent and careful planning is needed.</p></div></div></section>

A total of 812 studies describing a variety of interventions were identified as relevant to the map. Since the map was based on evidence relevant to the Swedish environment, it focused on forest types that are represented in Sweden (i.e. boreal and temperate), but such forests exist in many parts of the world (e.g., Russia, northern North America, southern parts of Australia). In accordance with accepted systematic mapping guidance [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="James KL, Randall NP, Haddaway NR.

The selection of topics was also based on their significance for managers of forest reserves and other stakeholders, and on their relevance to Swedish forests. Two of the suggested systematic reviews are currently in progress (the impact of dead wood on biodiversity [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 32" title="Bernes C, Jonsson BG, Junninen K, Lõhmus A, Macdonald E, Müller J, Sandström J.

The direct impacts of fire on tree regeneration, pyrophilous and saproxylic species have been well studied, and one of the systematic reviews in progress is investigating the effect of dead-wood manipulation (e.g. through burning) on biodiversity in forests [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 32" title="Bernes C, Jonsson BG, Junninen K, Lõhmus A, Macdonald E, Müller J, Sandström J.

However, the systematic review described herein focuses on the effects of prescribed burning on other aspects of biodiversity.</p><p>It would be valuable to broaden knowledge of how prescribed burning affects forest biodiversity, particularly because such effects could be viewed as either negative or positive. Additionally, the practice of prescribed burning is now fairly common in temperate and boreal forests worldwide, further indicating the need for thorough investigation of its impacts on species other than those that can be considered as pyrophilous or saproxylic. For example, the Life + Taiga project is a 5-year European Union funded programme (2015–2019) ongoing in Sweden [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Life + Taiga.

The project involves 14 regional County Administrative Boards and aims to perform 120 controlled fires in boreal forests, with the aim of conserving and restoring biodiversity.</p><p>A total of 227 studies in the systematic map of management interventions in temperate or boreal forests [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Bernes C, Jonsson BG, Junninen K, Lõhmus A, Macdonald E, Müller J, Sandström J.

Additional studies in the topic area have become available more recently, since the last search for evidence was undertaken by the map authors in 2015. The current literature lacks an up-to-date systematic review assessing the full evidence base on the impact of prescribed burning on biodiversity of temperate and boreal forests worldwide. This review addresses this need by exploring the often-ignored wider impacts of prescribed burning.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3">Stakeholder engagement</h3><p>We established the scope and focus of the review in close cooperation with stakeholders, following the outputs provided by the systematic map [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Bernes C, Jonsson BG, Junninen K, Lõhmus A, Macdonald E, Müller J, Sandström J.

Before submission, peer review, and final publication of the protocol, a draft version was open for public review at the website of the Mistra Council for Evidence-Based Environmental Management (Mistra EviEM) in July 2016. The draft was also sent directly to stakeholders. The draft protocol was revised in response to appropriate comments.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Objective of the systematic review</h3><p>The primary aim of this systematic review was to clarify if, and how, the diversity and richness of non-pyrophilous and non-saproxylic species in boreal and temperate forests is affected by prescribed burning. We searched not only for studies of interventions in actual forest reserves and other kinds of set-asides, but also for appropriate evidence from non-protected and commercially managed forests, since some of the practices applied in commercial forestry may be relevant to conservation or restoration. Quantitative synthesis of selected studies and a narrative synthesis were used to fulfil this aim.</p><p>The secondary aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of available evidence on how biodiversity of boreal and temperate forests (apart from that of pyrophilous and saproxylic species) is affected by prescribed burning. A systematic map of the evidence base was used to provide this overview.</p><p>The ultimate purpose of the review was to investigate whether prescribed burning may be used as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides, and if so, what conditions increase its effectiveness.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec5">Primary question</h4><p>What is the effect of prescribed burning in temperate and boreal forest on biodiversity, not including pyrophilous and saproxylic species?</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec6">Components of the question</h4><p>Population: boreal and temperate forests.</p><p>Intervention: prescribed burning.</p><p>Comparator: no burning or alternative levels of burning, before burning.</p><p>Outcomes: diversity and richness of species (excluding pyrophilous and saproxylic species) as one of a number of measures of biodiversity reported in the literature.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec7"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec7-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec7">Methods</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec7-content"><p>This review follows the methods outlined in an a priori protocol [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Eales J, Haddaway NR, Bernes C, Cooke SJ, Jonsson BG, Kouki J, Petrokofsky G.

However, we did not make efforts to include this evidence in our review since access is likely to be difficult and unevenly distributed [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Haddaway NR, Collins AM, Coughlin D, Kohl C.

Moreover, such an approach is unlikely to be repeatable or comprehensive, due to differences between companies in allowing third-party access to data.

This represents a change from the protocol, where we planned to assess titles and abstracts separately in two successive stages. This change reflected a decision that it was more efficient to screen titles and abstracts in EPPI Reviewer together. Sets of search results were allocated to reviewers (JE and JT) randomly. At no stage was a reviewer responsible for screening an article of which they were an author. In cases of uncertainty about inclusion decisions (for example where information was missing or unclear), the reviewer erred on the side of caution, choosing inclusion rather than exclusion.</p><p>Articles were assessed by a single reviewer (JE or JT). As a check of consistency, a random sample of 10% (377/3764) of the articles retrieved by the July 2016 search were screened for relevance at title and abstract by both reviewers, prior to screening of the full set of results.

Studies of intentional burning in the field were included, except where the primary purpose of burning was to control invasive species, because the characteristics of such burnings (extent, duration, intensity) are likely to be fundamentally different from other burns (typically for restoration or fuel reduction). Studies on wildfires were not included even if relevant control sites were available.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Relevant type of comparator</h5><p>Non-intervention or alternative levels of intervention. Both temporal and spatial comparisons of how prescribed burning affects biodiversity were considered to be relevant. This means that we included both ‘BA’ (before/after) studies, i.e. comparisons of the same site prior to and following an intervention, and ‘CI’ (control/impact) studies, i.e. comparisons of treated and untreated sites (or sites that had been subject to different kinds of treatment). Studies combining these types of comparison, i.e. those with a ‘BACI’ (before/after/control/impact) design, were also included.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Relevant types of outcome</h5><p>Diversity (e.g. Shannon and Simpson’s index of diversity) and richness of plants, animals, lichen, and fungi, except pyrophilous and saproxylic species. Studies of cavity-nesting birds and tree-roosting bats were included, as these species are not fully dependent on dead wood or fire. Studies which reported a representative list of species in the study area based on standard survey methods suitable for the taxa of study were included in the review, and the outcome was used as a measure of species richness, even if authors did not provide a total of the number of species listed or refer to species richness explicitly. Diversity or richness that was transformed or corrected, for example using jackknife estimates, was also regarded as relevant. In addition to diversity and richness, our review protocol listed abundance of communities or species as a relevant outcome [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Eales J, Haddaway NR, Bernes C, Cooke SJ, Jonsson BG, Kouki J, Petrokofsky G.

The protocol also listed community composition as a relevant outcome, but this was rarely reported in the studies we encountered, and the review team decided to focus on the most commonly reported biodiversity measures. The following specific outcomes were not considered eligible since they are measures of beta diversity: Jaccard’s diversity index (a measure of species turnover rather than diversity); similarity indices, such as Sorensen’s similarity index (not a measure of diversity). Seed bank diversity and richness were excluded because the seed bank represents a source of colonisation, rather than an established plant community, the latter being the focus of our review. Although we have chosen not to review seed bank diversity, we recognise that this is a topic of interest that may warrant a separate evidence synthesis.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22">Relevant type of study</h5><p>Primary field studies (observational or manipulative).

This deviates from the protocol, which stated that all studies would be critically appraised.</p><p>Critical appraisal of study validity was conducted on all quantitatively synthesised studies to ensure that: (1) all data used in meta-analyses was of sufficient quality to be reliable and generalisable across the evidence base; and (2) studies that were of the highest reliability could be identified to examine possible influences of bias on the results of meta-analyses (via sensitivity analysis, see below). The criteria used for study validity assessment are presented in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#Tab2">2</a>. These criteria reflect what the review team deemed to be critical variables influencing the reliability of study findings. They relate to both internal validity (methodological quality) and external validity (generalisability), and include: efforts by study authors to measure and control for baseline differences before intervention; the level of replication and representativeness of samples; allocation of samples and matching of control and intervention sites; the presence of severe confounders; appropriateness and suitability of the application of the intervention; and, the suitability of the outcome measurement methods. For each of these domains, studies were categorised as to how well they fulfilled the criteria: yes, partly, no, or unclear. Based on these categories for individual domains in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#Tab2">2</a>, each study was then given an overall rating of high, medium, medium (unclear), or low validity, using the procedure presented in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#Tab3">3</a>. The category of medium (unclear) was given to studies that were assigned “unclear” and not “partly” for one or more domains and “yes” for all other domains, as detailed in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#Tab3">3</a>. This does not relate to study validity directly (unclear studies are not necessarily less valid), but we believe it is dangerous to assume that information that is missing would otherwise relate to high validity in our review. Thus, we treat studies without the highest reporting quality in the same way as we do those without the highest methodological quality or generalisability. These studies are clearly separated in all reporting within this review.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Study validity assessment criteria</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5/tables/2"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div> <div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3 Overall assessment of study validity/risk of bias</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5/tables/3"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div><p>Where necessary, detailed reasoning concerning validity assessment was recorded alongside the categorisations.

Meta-data relating to study location were extracted from the included articles where possible, but if no geographical coordinates were given, we recorded approximate coordinates based on reported site names, maps or textual descriptions of study locations (or coordinates provided in another article describing the same site). Where coordinates given by study authors were clearly incorrect, we recorded coordinates based on other information provided by the study (e.g. distance from a named place or point of interest).</p><p>We recorded the number of independent burn/control areas and the number of replicate samples within burn/control areas. Spatial replication was recorded as the number of samples measured within each independent burn unit (intervention or comparator site). If treated sites and controls were not replicated to the same extent, we recorded each number separately. If the number of replicates within independent burn or control areas varied, we recorded the range in the number of replicate samples.</p><p>In cases where some of the data reported by a study fell outside the scope of our review (e.g. where some of the study sites were located outside relevant vegetation zones), we recorded information only for those parts of the study that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.</p><p>The meta-data coding was undertaken by JT and JE.

<p>Two studies reported natural levels of grazing in both burned and unburned plots and were included in the meta-analysis.

Data on interventions and other potential effect modifiers were extracted from the included articles. We also recorded, where reported, the reason for burning, i.e. burn intention.</p><p>Some studies were unclear about the level of replication used. Where possible for these studies, we extracted two measures of sample size: the total number of subsamples and the number of true replicates (the number of replicates we deemed to represent independent samples).</p><p>Where data were reported by authors as a range, for example a range of burn frequencies, we used the mid-point value of the range to represent the data.

For studies in the northern hemisphere, autumn/winter started from September and lasted 6 calendar months. For studies undertaken in the southern hemisphere, autumn/winter started from March.</p><p>We recognise that the terms “saproxylic” and “pyrophilous” may be used differently by different authors, and whether an organism can be classed as one of the above is also likely to depend upon landscape or regional elements. Where reported in studies included in our meta-analyses, the maximum percentage of saproxylic/pyrophilous species within a studied community was approximately 25%. Since it was not reported whether these species groups were present in the surveyed communities for most comparisons in the quantitative synthesis (207/219), the review team decided to include the 12 comparisons that stated that they included saproxylic/pyrophilous species as part of the surveyed community. As stated in the inclusion criteria, studies where only saproxylic/pyrophilous species were recorded were not eligible for this systematic review.</p><p>A further check was undertaken by JT and JE on 9% (8/98) of the studies, with all decisions discussed in order to maximise the consistency of coding between reviewers.

We also produced an evidence atlas, an interactive geographical information system (GIS). The evidence atlas plots study locations on a world map, and data on the studies can be displayed by clicking on the symbols in the map. Both the evidence atlas and the database allow data to be filtered and sorted.

This was necessary because when using “Simpson’s D”, which ranges from 0 to 1, a positive effect size indicates lower diversity, which is the opposite direction to the other indices used in our meta-analysis, such as Shannon diversity. The definition of Simpson’s index used was generally poorly reported. Because Simpson’s can also be reported as a reciprocal, i.e. 1/D, wherever authors reported Simpson’s index with a value greater than 1, we made the assumption that the authors used the reciprocal.</p><p>We combined Shannon and Simpson indices from different studies in the same meta-analyses, since these indices are standardised and we are comparing differences between scale-free values. Although it would have been informative to determine the influence of the choice of diversity index on the effect size, the low number of studies prevented us from undertaking such a sensitivity analysis.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec35">Separation of studies</h4><p>For the purposes of this review, we defined a study as an experiment or observation that was undertaken over a specific time period at a particular site or set of sites. If multiple articles reported data for the same study site(s), they were given the same “Site ID” and were essentially considered as reports of the same study. If a single article reported data separately for different sites that we considered to be ecologically independent, we assigned a separate Site ID to each site. For the rest of this report we refer to independent effect estimates used in meta-analyses as ‘comparisons’. Hence, one article and one location could be represented in multiple outcomes in the same meta-analysis. Similarly, one study could be represented by multiple comparisons across multiple meta-analyses of different outcomes.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec36">Adjustment accounting for pseudoreplication</h4><p>Where we were aware (based on information in publications or from contact with authors) or had reason to assume that published outcomes were based on partly subsampled data (i.e. averaged samples were not from independent replicates), we calculated effect sizes using a modified equation to avoid overestimation of effect sizes. First, standard errors were converted to standard deviations using total numbers of subsamples as sample sizes (so as to be conservative). Hedges’ <i>g</i> effect sizes (based on Equations 4.19 and 4.22 in Borenstein et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Borenstein M, Hedges L, Higgins JP, Rothstein H.

This method gives the most conservative estimate of variability.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec37">Quantitative synthesis—meta-analysis</h4><p>We ran random effects meta-analysis models in R [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="R Core Team.

For each model, we declared Site ID (a unique code for each independent study site or set of sites) as a random factor to account for multiple outcomes being reported from the same location. We only performed meta-analysis where more than three comparisons could be combined. We produced forest plots to visualise effect sizes from individual comparisons and summary effect estimates across groups of comparable studies.</p><p>After producing unmoderated models and forest plots, we analysed the influence of the following moderators within studies with sufficient data, also assessing the influence of the moderator on residual heterogeneity:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Time since burning (time between last burn and outcome measure).</p></li><li><p>Burn frequency: the number of burns per year across the study period, defined as the time between first burn and last sampling. A frequency of 1 was used when a study lasted &lt; 1 year.</p></li><li><p>Burn season (“dormant” or “growing”).</p></li><li><p>Climate zone (Köppen–Geiger zones Cf, Cs, Df, Ds).</p></li><li><p>Forest type (broadleaf, coniferous, mixed).</p></li></ul>
<p>We investigated the influence of moderators individually rather than combining all moderators in one model because many studies did not report all information.</p><p>We examined the robustness of our results in several ways. First, we produced funnel plots to identify cases where publication bias might be present [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 48" title="Light RJ, Pillemer DB.

We did this using 1/(square root of sample size) as a measure of precision, since standard errors are inappropriate for funnel plots of standardised effect sizes [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Zackrisson O.

Secondly, we examined the influence of the validity of studies as judged during validity assessment. We repeated our unmoderated model calculations using only ‘high validity’ studies (where n &gt; 3) and examined whether our findings altered. Thirdly, we calculated and plotted Cook’s distance for each unmoderated model to identify highly influential studies or groups of studies. Finally, we calculated fail-safe numbers for meta-analyses showing significant summary effect estimates (<i>fsn</i> function within the <i>metafor</i> package in R [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Viechtbauer W.

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec48">Quantitative synthesis</h4><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec49">Study validity critical appraisal results</h5><p>Sixteen studies were excluded from full synthesis due to low validity (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#MOESM4">4</a>). The main reasons for exclusion were: intervention was not externally valid (7 studies, e.g. extremely high intensity burning); likely high heterogeneity between treatment and control sites (3 studies); inappropriate outcome measurement method (3 studies) and confounders present (3 studies, confounded by previous burning or pest outbreaks).</p><p>Of the remaining 82 studies eligible for full quantitative synthesis, only 19 were categorised as having high validity (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#MOESM10">10</a>). The other 63 studies were considered to have medium validity, most commonly because they were either BA or CI studies, not BACI, or because they only partially accounted for spatial heterogeneity in treatment allocation. Three studies of potentially “high validity” were downgraded to “medium validity (unclear)” because of a lack of information on their methods, warranting a conservative approach.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec50">Justification for burning</h5><p>We found that for most studies from the USA the burns were conducted for multiple purposes; both for fuel reduction and for promotion of biodiversity. Finnish studies (from two projects) investigated burning to promote biodiversity, as did one Canadian study. All Australian studies (n = 4) and the Spanish study had the aim of fuel reduction. The remaining studies did not report the intention of the burn.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec51">Quantified outcomes</h5><p>From the 82 studies, we identified 219 comparisons (i.e. effect size estimates) for use in our quantitative synthesis (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#MOESM8">8</a>). Thirty-one comparisons referred to diversity using Shannon diversity index, 8 used Simpson’s index and 1 employed the Brillouin diversity index. Most of these comparisons referred to species diversity, but 1 comparison was of the diversity of species or genera, 4 comparisons were made at the order level and 2 comparisons referred to family- or order-level diversity. Most richness comparisons were made at the species level (173 comparisons), but 6 comparisons were of the richness of species or genera and 2 were of the richness of orders or families.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec52">Study duration and timing</h5><p>The duration of study (time between the first burn and the last outcome measurement) and the time since burning (time between the last burn and the last outcome measurement) for the 219 comparisons in the quantitative syntheses are presented in Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#Fig5">5</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#Fig6">6</a>.

In all other quantitative analyses, we found no consistent effects on species richness and diversity on non-pyrophilous and non-saproxylic species from prescribed burning. This was likely due to large inter-study variation in outcomes, due to high heterogeneity between studies, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis.

Interestingly, based on our results, this variation was not primarily a between-species phenomenon but rather a between-study phenomenon, meaning that separate studies on the same taxonomic or ecological groups revealed contrasting outcomes.</p><p>We contend that our observation that the effects of burning on species richness and diversity are highly variable across studies is ecologically valid. This is supported by studies that have simultaneously analysed multiple species and verified variable responses also at a more detailed scale (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 29" title="Hyvärinen E, Kouki J, Martikainen P.

In ecological systems, there is typically quite a high level of idiosyncrasy, depending on variable biotic and abiotic circumstances as well as historical events. When studies from highly variable contexts are combined in a meta-analysis, the influence on the outcome of a given treatment (burning in our case) is also expected to be variable [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Gurevitch J, Hedges LV. Statistical issues in ecological meta-analyses. Ecology. 1999;80(4):1142–9." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#ref-CR60" id="ref-link-section-d75554e3727">60</a>]. We attempted to account for some contextual moderators, such as forest type and climate zone. Three moderators were found to have a significant impact on the effects of burning on herbaceous plant richness; for instance, richness increased significantly after burning in broadleaf forests but not in coniferous and mixed forests. However, in many of our analyses the small number of comparable studies combined with the substantial heterogeneity limited the power of moderators to explain the variability in outcomes.</p><p>As well as ecological context, differences in the application of the intervention are likely to have a strong influence on the study results. We attempted to account for the following moderators: season of burning, the time since the area was burned, and the frequency of burn events. There are other factors that we were unable to incorporate into the analysis that may also influence outcomes (e.g. soil type and moisture, humidity, wind, etc.; see below). In addition, the reason for conducting the prescribed burn may also influence outcomes. In our review, only two of 82 studies in the quantitative analysis [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Nuzzo VA, McClain W, Strole T.

The importance of the impact on these services and their contextual dependence are worthy of exploration, possibly in a systematic review.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec65">Reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>At least four main factors contribute to the high level of heterogeneity in the observed effects of prescribed burning.</p><p>First, although the review was restricted to boreal and temperate forests, there was noticeable regional variation among the study systems. In terms of regional coverage, the availability of studies was clearly biased towards North America: in total, out of the 219 comparisons that were eligible for the meta-analysis, 197 were from North America, which encompasses a large area with heterogeneity in biotic and abiotic composition within our specified climate zones. Some studies (7 comparisons) were conducted in Australian eucalypt forests that appear to have distinctive fire regimes not found in other regions, possibly because of the particular characteristics of eucalypt trees, such as oil in leaves encouraging an intense fire that is more damaging to less fire-attuned species [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Fairman TA, Nitschke CR, Bennett LT.

Weather conditions, topography, and the amount of combustible biomass may considerably affect the severity and, thus, the ecological consequences of prescribed burning. For example, Gundale et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 67" title="Gundale MJ, Metlen KL, Fiedler CE, DeLuca TH. Nitrogen spatial heterogeneity influences diversity following restoration in a ponderosa pine forest, Montana.

This variation is an inherent feature of most controlled burns. The prescribed burn area studied by Elliot et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Elliott K, Vose J, Hendrick R. Long-term effects of high intensity prescribed fire on vegetation dynamics in the Wine Spring Creek Watershed, western North Carolina, USA. Fire Ecol. 2009;5(2):66–85." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0131-5#ref-CR68" id="ref-link-section-d75554e3768">68</a>] had recorded temperatures of &lt; 80 °C on lower slopes but &gt; 800 °C on upper slopes and ridges. The burns with the highest intensity were described as stand-replacing fire which consumed understorey vegetation and ignited crowns. Similarly, there is likely great variability in the training and experience of the fire team and the proximity to human structures which may influence aversion to “risk”. Assessing the comparability of controlled burns is hindered by the often brief reporting of burn characteristics.</p><p>Third, the review covered species that are both taxonomically and ecologically highly heterogeneous and, thus, may be expected to show variable responses to fire. Our meta-analyses of taxonomic groups necessarily combined studies focusing on different subgroups which may have responded in different ways to burning, thus reducing the accuracy of the summary effect size and resulting in a less meaningful summary. Pyrophilous and saproxylic species may be expected to benefit from fires where there is mortality of trees during and after a fire event, though in situations where trees are not killed, saproxylics can suffer because of a net loss of dead wood. Other species respond in a range of different ways according to, for example, their motility, habitat preference, germination requirements or seed release mechanisms. A meta-analysis of such diverse taxa could benefit from arranging them into groups based on other characteristics than their taxonomic status. For example, separate analyses of species sharing specific life-history characteristics, such as r- or K-selected species, could provide more detailed understanding of causal factors. Unfortunately, studies usually do not provide such data, and it is often impossible to classify species in this way afterwards, particularly where studies report richness or diversity of mixed groups.</p><p>Finally, the sampling methods used to quantify the impacts of prescribed burning varied widely across studies. Methods are chosen by authors to be relevant for the focal species groups, but such methods do not necessarily provide comparable data when combined (in a meta-analysis) across different species groups. For example, taxonomic groups that are very diverse (such as beetles) and hence a significant part of biodiversity are often challenging to sample efficiently and representatively [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Martikainen P, Kouki J.

Depending on the exact method used to capture beetles, such as widely used window-traps or pitfall traps, quite different patterns of the community may be revealed even if samples are assumed to represent communities from the same forest stand [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Martikainen P, Kouki J.

A related problem is that our reviewed studies rarely report beta-diversity across samples and sites. Hence, if an effect of the fire is to increase variability in species composition it might not be captured by plot-based species richness or diversity estimates. This clearly mirrors the concern raised by Socolar et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Socolar JB, Gilroy JJ, Kunin WE, Edwards DP.

Although a fire event is always abrupt, its consequences have long-lasting impacts, and many ecological effects may only be revealed by time series data that cover at least a few decades following a fire [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Bradstock RA, Williams JE, Gill MA.

Only rarely have studies been able to assess such long-term effects and hence capture the successional dynamics after the fire [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Wittkuhn RS, McCaw L, Wills AJ, Robinson R, Andersen AN, Van Heurck P, Farr J, Liddelow G, Cranfield R.

The length of the monitoring period is likely to have a major influence on the heterogeneity of the patterns observed in the reviewed studies. For example, short-term studies may be able to capture data on how different species colonise burned areas, but to reveal if species are also able to reproduce and establish populations on these sites requires studies that cover multiple generations for species of interest. We have recorded where studies measured time-series, but due to low comparability across studies, we did not extract or analyse such data for this review. Instead, our analysis has focused on the data reported for the maximum time since fire.</p><p>Whilst we recognise that the limited number of studies available for meta-analyses limits the ability of moderators to explain heterogeneity, the moderators tested generally had little effect. The only exception is for herbaceous plant species richness. In this case, the effect size was found to decrease with time since burning and also differ between climate zones. There was also a significant effect of forest type, with herbaceous plant richness in broadleaf forests showing a positive response to prescribed burning. Reasons why increased time since burn may have a negative effect on herbaceous plant richness could include gap dynamics leading to initial colonisation followed by competitive exclusion of some species [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 71" title="Hansson L.

However, as the dormant and growing seasons may span across the calendar cut-offs (which we used in most cases) and since authors generally did not report burn seasons clearly, the burn season moderator is subject to inconsistencies. This is likely to contribute to noise and limits the ability of the moderator to explain heterogeneity in our datasets.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec66">Knowledge gaps and clusters</h3><p>We identified knowledge gaps and clusters across all of the 244 studies in the review (including both meta-analysed studies as well as in the systematic map) to determine the representation of topics in the evidence base.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec67">Forest types and locations</h4><p>The low number of mixed forest studies represents a clear knowledge gap. We also note the lack of studies from the relevant climate zones in Russia, Kazakhstan, Northern China, Eastern Europe and New Zealand, and the seemingly low number of studies from Canada and Fennoscandia. Within the included European studies (15 comparisons, from Western Europe), coverage was incomplete. The dominance of North American studies is a clear knowledge cluster (75% of the evidence base in the entire review and 90% of comparisons in the quantitative synthesis). It is plausible that there is relevant literature from some of the underrepresented regions in other languages that we could not include, or alternatively evidence that has not been referenced in broadly accessible literature sources. It appears that studies on prescribed burnings from Fennoscandia mainly focus on pyrophilous and saproxylic species, and such studies were excluded from this review.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec68">Biodiversity outcome</h4><p>Whilst 74% of comparisons eligible for our quantitative synthesis referred to plant taxa, only 26% referred to other taxa. Some 83% of total comparisons reported on richness, whilst 17% comparisons reported diversity, demonstrating a strong skew towards richness reporting in the evidence base for the quantitative synthesis. Diversity studies typically reported Shannon diversity (76% of comparisons) rather than Simpson’s diversity (21% of comparisons).

In all other quantitative analyses, we found no consistent positive or negative effects on species richness and diversity of non-pyrophilous and non-saproxylic species. This was likely due to high inter-study heterogeneity, and low numbers of comparable studies in each quantitative synthesis. We found no consistent effects of moderators and were unable to test the effect of many potential moderators, due to a lack of reporting. We note that the actual outcomes in any particular case are still difficult to predict, and any forest restoration or management project using burning should include a component of monitoring in order to build a stronger evidence base for recommendations and guidelines on how to best achieve identified conservation targets. There are situations where prescribed burning can have harmful effects on taxa that are conservation-dependent, such as epiphytic lichens [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 77" title="Hämäläinen A, Kouki J, Lõhmus P.

Thus, for these groups especially, a longer monitoring period would be highly justified and we call on funders and researchers to undertake such long-term investigation. We also call for increased research focusing on the impacts of prescribed burning on non-plant organisms, in particular fungi, birds, herpetofauna, and mammals.</p><p>A large number of studies (96/244) could not be included in the quantitative synthesis due to an unfortunate lack of replication or reporting of measures of variability within their data. We thus call on researchers to better report variability in summary data or provide access to raw data so that these statistics can be calculated by meta-analysts.</p><p>We therefore identify three needs, which, if addressed, would improve the usability of results both in a review like this and for management: (1) document burning severity and fire behaviour and, if possible, conduct experimental burnings where the severity of fire can be manipulated; (2) if possible, replicate treatments in units that are independent of each other; and, (3) monitor the response over long time periods, i.e. decades rather than a few years. Though similar recommendations have been proposed by authors of previous reviews of prescribed burning impacts [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Fernandes PM, Botelho HS.

Possible barriers to uptake may include difficulty/danger in documenting fire severity, and management or ecological constraints in the assignment of fully replicated experimental plots. The resources required for long-term monitoring and staffing turnover combined with differences in monitoring capacity of staff are also a likely constraint on experimental design and reporting. Co-designed or co-implemented research, whereby the skills and resources of practitioners and researchers are used to implement robust prescribed burning experiments, may be a way to overcome these barriers.</p><p>Burning of a forest system is a management practice that requires long-term commitment to implementation and monitoring of outcomes. Given that a large number of relevant prescribed burning experiments have been initiated, the ground has been set for long-term studies. Coming generations of researchers may be best advised to make use of existing study systems, some of which are identified in this review, thereby enabling outcomes to be monitored over very long periods.</p></div></div></section>
