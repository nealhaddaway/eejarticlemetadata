        <title>What evidence is available on the drivers of grassland ecosystem stability across a range of outcome measurements: a systematic map protocol | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Recently there has been considerable focus on the ecosystem services concept which has resulted in important advancements in biodiversity conservation across land management scales. Many have, however, cautioned against the ecosystem services approach because of its focus only on certain aspects of the ecosystem which may be unsustainable in the long term. This has encouraged calls for deeper study into ecosystem functioning using an holistic ecosystem multifunctionality framework. Here greater biodiversity is thought to facilitate greater functioning leading to more sustainable ecosystems. Although ecosystem multifunctionality is a relatively recent development, the general premise is based on the hypothesis that diversity begets stability. However, several key review syntheses have consistently called for ecosystem stability driver-outcome relationship studies to extend beyond traditional measurements. Understanding these relationships requires holistic approaches which are often challenging to investigate experimentally due to resource constraints. Systematically mapping out the relationships between various stability drivers and outcomes could provide a more empirical basis on which both the ecosystem multifunctionality and services land management frameworks could be based. This work outlines the protocol for the first systematic map which will identify and catalogue diversity&#8211;stability related studies within the grassland biome. The outcomes of this study will produce a searchable database of the body of literature relevant to the debate and suggest future research directions in both empirical and applied ecology fields. Relevant studies will be sourced from online databases. Inclusion criteria will be applied to the returned articles to identify studies relevant to the primary question; what evidence is available on the drivers of grassland ecosystem stability across a range of outcome measurements. These inclusion criteria will be based on (1) subject population&#8212;the grassland biome; (2) possible ecosystem stability drivers and comparators (i.e. measures of diversity, functioning, food web connectedness, and disturbances); and (3) stability outcomes considering all measures of ecosystem stability (i.e. coefficients of variation, changes in ecosystem functionality, resistance to disturbances and invasions, return rates following disturbance). Studies will be screened for relevance and included articles will be critically appraised for meta-analysis and systematic review potential. A narrative synthesis, together with a searchable and expandable database, will be compiled to catalogue the relevant studies. Descriptive summary statistics and bibliometric network analyses will also be presented."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Recently there has been considerable focus on the ecosystem services concept which has resulted in important advancements in biodiversity conservation across land management scales. Many have, however, cautioned against the ecosystem services approach because of its focus only on certain aspects of the ecosystem which may be unsustainable in the long term. This has encouraged calls for deeper study into ecosystem functioning using an holistic ecosystem multifunctionality framework. Here greater biodiversity is thought to facilitate greater functioning leading to more sustainable ecosystems. Although ecosystem multifunctionality is a relatively recent development, the general premise is based on the hypothesis that diversity begets stability. However, several key review syntheses have consistently called for ecosystem stability driver-outcome relationship studies to extend beyond traditional measurements. Understanding these relationships requires holistic approaches which are often challenging to investigate experimentally due to resource constraints. Systematically mapping out the relationships between various stability drivers and outcomes could provide a more empirical basis on which both the ecosystem multifunctionality and services land management frameworks could be based. This work outlines the protocol for the first systematic map which will identify and catalogue diversity–stability related studies within the grassland biome. The outcomes of this study will produce a searchable database of the body of literature relevant to the debate and suggest future research directions in both empirical and applied ecology fields. Relevant studies will be sourced from online databases. Inclusion criteria will be applied to the returned articles to identify studies relevant to the primary question; what evidence is available on the drivers of grassland ecosystem stability across a range of outcome measurements. These inclusion criteria will be based on (1) subject population—the grassland biome; (2) possible ecosystem stability drivers and comparators (i.e. measures of diversity, functioning, food web connectedness, and disturbances); and (3) stability outcomes considering all measures of ecosystem stability (i.e. coefficients of variation, changes in ecosystem functionality, resistance to disturbances and invasions, return rates following disturbance). Studies will be screened for relevance and included articles will be critically appraised for meta-analysis and systematic review potential. A narrative synthesis, together with a searchable and expandable database, will be compiled to catalogue the relevant studies. Descriptive summary statistics and bibliometric network analyses will also be presented."/>

Many have, however, cautioned against the ecosystem services approach because of its focus only on certain aspects of the ecosystem which may be unsustainable in the long term. This has encouraged calls for deeper study into ecosystem functioning using an holistic ecosystem multifunctionality framework. Here greater biodiversity is thought to facilitate greater functioning leading to more sustainable ecosystems. Although ecosystem multifunctionality is a relatively recent development, the general premise is based on the hypothesis that diversity begets stability. However, several key review syntheses have consistently called for ecosystem stability driver-outcome relationship studies to extend beyond traditional measurements. Understanding these relationships requires holistic approaches which are often challenging to investigate experimentally due to resource constraints. Systematically mapping out the relationships between various stability drivers and outcomes could provide a more empirical basis on which both the ecosystem multifunctionality and services land management frameworks could be based. This work outlines the protocol for the first systematic map which will identify and catalogue diversity–stability related studies within the grassland biome. The outcomes of this study will produce a searchable database of the body of literature relevant to the debate and suggest future research directions in both empirical and applied ecology fields.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Relevant studies will be sourced from online databases. Inclusion criteria will be applied to the returned articles to identify studies relevant to the primary question; what evidence is available on the drivers of grassland ecosystem stability across a range of outcome measurements. These inclusion criteria will be based on (1) subject population—the grassland biome; (2) possible ecosystem stability drivers and comparators (i.e. measures of diversity, functioning, food web connectedness, and disturbances); and (3) stability outcomes considering all measures of ecosystem stability (i.e. coefficients of variation, changes in ecosystem functionality, resistance to disturbances and invasions, return rates following disturbance). Studies will be screened for relevance and included articles will be critically appraised for meta-analysis and systematic review potential. A narrative synthesis, together with a searchable and expandable database, will be compiled to catalogue the relevant studies. Descriptive summary statistics and bibliometric network analyses will also be presented.</p></div></div></section>

The more unique species present in the community, the greater the number of functions within the community.

Data for this map will be sourced from experimental, quasi-experimental and observational studies conducted in natural, conserved, and agricultural grassland settings from across the globe. The outputs of this systematic map will consist of a narrative synthesis summarising the evidence pertaining to the different driver and outcome measures of ecosystem stability. This will be presented together with suggestions on how these data can be used by theoretical, pure, and applied ecologists and the ecosystem services discipline. The narrative synthesis will be accompanied by a searchable and expandable database documenting the driver-outcome relationships of grassland ecosystem stability research.</p><p>There have also been recent calls that solutions to the problem of ecosystem sustainability should be based on ideas synthesised from the pure ecology discipline and then implemented into society at large [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Manning P, Plas F, Soliveres S, Allan E, Maestre FT, Mace G, Whittingham MJ, Fischer M.

Depending on the focus of the article, studies within the savanna biome may also be included. Studies where the grassland has been structurally altered anthropogenically into a monocrop or has experienced dramatic urbanisation will not be included.</p><p><i>Intervention/exposure</i> Potential drivers of grassland ecosystem stability largely acknowledged in the ecological literature. These could include positive drivers such as diversity and connectedness but also negative drivers such as invasions or climatic instabilities.</p><p><i>Comparator</i> Absence or lack of a driver or alternatively a treatment application gradient. This treatment gradient could be different levels or frequency of a disturbance or different numbers of species within a plant community.</p><p><i>Outcome</i> Measures of grassland ecosystem stability largely acknowledged in the ecological literature.

Articles within reference lists of reviews identified as relevant to the primary question but not included in the final analysis will also be included in the search.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec15">Assessing the specificity and sensitivity of the search</h4><p>Comprehensiveness tests of the search terms was assessed using ISI Web of Science (results are documented in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0137-z#MOESM2">2</a>). Each proposed population search term was queried together with AND (*stabl* OR *stability*). The full population search string together with AND (*stabl* OR *stability*) was then queried together with each driver term. Finally, the full population and driver search strings were queried together with each stability outcome search term. Each term’s specificity was assessed by recording the number of hits returned for each term and the proportion of relevant results (out of 50 citations screened at title level). To give an indication of each term’s (and each full string’s) sensitivity the number of test list articles returned was also recorded. The test list (also contained within Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0137-z#MOESM2">2</a>) was developed based both on contributions from stakeholders via the survey and from the review team. All stakeholder and review team test article suggestions were then considered, and a final list was developed which covered a range of topics relating to the components of the primary question as well as being drawn from various key journals and authors. The final search term included all articles in the test list.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec16">Article retrieval strategy</h4><p>All articles obtained during this systematic map will be stored in bibliographic files. A log file recording the time and date of each database search will be kept together with these source files. All databases will then be loaded into EndNote X8, compiled into one library and duplicate references will be removed. This library will then be exported and will then be uploaded to CADIMA (<a href="https://www.cadima.info/">https://www.cadima.info/</a>). Inclusion/exclusion criteria will then be applied. We will exclude publications for which we cannot access the full text as it will be needed to accurately assess the study validity and accurately code and catalogue. When we do not have access to the full text we will attempt to acquire the article through inter-library loans or by contacting the authors via email.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17">Article screening and study eligibility criteria</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec18">Article screening</h4><p>Search results will be screened by all members of the review team working independently with equal workloads over three stages: title, abstract, and full text. Before each screening stage the reviewers’ study screening consistency will be assessed using Kappa statistics. These statistics will be based on the reviewers’ decisions made on 10% of the total records to be screened up to a maximum of 200 records per reviewer. If there is not substantial consensus between the reviewers (K &lt; 0.6) then discrepancies in the inclusion criteria will be discussed to clarify or revise the inclusion criteria to ensure consistent screening by all authors. Each title, abstract and full text article will be screened by two reviewers with any discrepancies at this level screening will be addressed by the third reviewer. If there is still uncertainty the article will be included for screening at the subsequent level. Articles included at title level will then be screened at abstract level. Articles included at the abstract level will then be screened at the full text level. If a reviewer has authored a returned article, this article will be screened by two other members of the review team or an external reviewer who has been briefed sufficiently on the screening protocol.</p><p>Conflicting inclusion/exclusion decisions at the abstract and full text screening stages will be addressed by consensus of the review team. Publications found by means other than publication database searches will enter the screening process at the abstract screening stage (if an abstract is available) or the full text stage.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec19">Eligibility criteria</h4><p>Each study will have to fulfil the following criteria to be included in the map.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Relevant subjects</h5><p>Grasslands across the globe. Grasslands may include any extensively managed, conserved, undisturbed or disturbed region which is primarily dominated by grasses and forbs, shrubs, crusts, and or succulents. Including studies concerning dramatic anthropogenic influence (e.g. ecological restoration, intensive agricultural practices) may provide useful insight and so we will include these studies as well as studies conducted in natural systems. However, studies where the grassland has been structurally altered anthropogenically into a monocrop or has experienced dramatic urbanisation will not be included. As this map is focussed on grasslands, studies conducted within savanna or forest habitats will not be targeted in this map. However, those which address the dynamics between grassland and wooded states will be included. Whether a study took place in a savanna biome will be determined based on the reference to tree–grass interactions in the article’s study site or experimental design; article inclusion will be conservative. No studies conducted in fresh (e.g. wetlands, deltas, marshes) or marine (seagrass meadows, beaches) aquatic systems will be included. However, studies conducted in grasslands occurring along the boundaries of any of these systems will be included. Studies documenting “paleo-grasslands” will not be included.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Relevant stability drivers</h5><p>Drivers may be any measure of diversity (e.g. alpha, beta, gamma, richness), climate (e.g. precipitation, fire, drought, temperature), disturbance (e.g. grazing, fertilisation), trophic level complexity (number of levels, number of nodes, network asymmetry, network nestedness). Other drivers may be identified as screening progresses. These will be considered on a case by case basis.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22">Relevant types of comparators</h5><p>Either driver treatment gradients or levels (e.g. comparisons across numbers of connections within a food web or numbers of functional groups, or various intensities of experimentally imposed or naturally occurring drought) or absence of a driver treatment serving as a control.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23">Relevant types of outcomes</h5><p>There must be a measurement of stability reported in the study’s results. This may include variability (or its inverse), coefficient of variation, network stability, rates of ecosystem functioning, persistence following disturbance, return time until reaching a pre-disturbance state, transitions into alternate stable states or temporal fluctuations. Studies which allude to their results being important in the diversity–stability debate without actively quantifying stability will be included in the map and will be categorised accordingly.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Relevant types of study</h5><p>Experimental, quasi-experimental, greenhouse, microcosm, laboratory (only those incorporating grassland taxa) or observational studies addressing the primary question will be included. Modelling, opinion, synthesis, commentary, and narrative review articles which are found to relevant will also be included in the database and will be coded accordingly for easier future reference.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec25">Language</h5><p>Only studies published in English will be included during screening.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26">Date</h5><p>No date restrictions will be applied.</p><p>Bibliographic data for all articles included in the final database will be extracted and included in the final report. All articles excluded at full text level together with reasons for exclusion will be provided in a separate database table in the final systematic map.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27">Study validity assessment</h3><p>Because of the breadth of this systematic map and the variety of methods and experimental designs study validity assessment will not be applied to this systematic map. However, basic descriptions of the experimental protocols will be recorded to assist in identifying areas of future more detailed critical appraisal and synthesis on smaller, more homogenous sub-sections of the final systematic map.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28">Data coding strategy</h3><p>Following full-text screening included article metadata will be extracted by all members of the review team. Bibliographic information, experiment metadata and driver/outcome data will be extracted and categorised subjectively based on reviewer interpretations of the article. Bibliographic data will be extracted from the citation record. Experimental metadata will consist of the country where the experiment was conducted, the type of grassland the experiment was conducted in, the land use type of the grassland during the experiment (intensive grazing, roadside, old croplands, restored mine dump etc.), the start and end dates of the experiment, the type of experiment (laboratory, field trial, modelling etc.) the length of the experiment, and bioclimatic data. In order to standardise climatic metadata across all sites bioclimatic data will be extracted from the WorldClim database [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 80" title="WorldClim Version 2. &#xA;                    http://worldclim.org/version2&#xA;                    &#xA;                  .

The type and measurement scale used to quantify driver and stability measurements will be also recorded. For each of these aspects four levels of data (category, sub-category, data type, and measurement scale) will be recorded. The destabilising effect (if any) will also be recorded here together with the directional response of the system to the destabilising effect following an increase in driver magnitude.</p><p>Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0137-z#Tab1">1</a> summarises the tables and each table’s associated fields which the final systematic map database file will contain. Data coding has been piloted with the first 25 records returned from a Web of Science Core Collection search using the full search query (<a href="https://stuart-demmer.shinyapps.io/grassland-ecosystem-stability-systematic-map/">https://stuart-demmer.shinyapps.io/grassland-ecosystem-stability-systematic-map/</a>). Categories used for categorical fields will be continually populated as the review proceeds. The article’s DOI will be employed when constructing relationships between tables for complex querying and filtering. As multiple drivers and outcomes may be measured for one study, there may be multiple records for each study in the drivers and outcomes tables. Each stability driver will be linked to an outcome measurement based on decisions made by the authors of the study. If this relationship is not explicitly stated by the authors, the reviewers will decide which stability outcome to associate with which driver based on the results of the article. Where there is more than one article for a study area (for example, where more than one study has been published for one experimental site), each study will be recorded independently but all these studies will be cross referenced using a shared ‘Experiment site ID’ field value.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-1"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab1" data-test="table-caption">Table 1 Systematic map database tables (column headings) and associated fields (rows)</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0137-z/tables/1"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<p>To test the repeatability of the data extraction strategy before beginning data coding, each member of the review team will independently code data from a subset of 30 included articles. Where there are inconsistencies between reviewers, the data extraction process will be discussed and revised. Once inconsistencies in data coding are rectified, data coding will be conducted by all members of the review team.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29">Study mapping and presentation</h3><p>The systematic map database will describe the current evidence pertaining to the drivers and outcome measurements of grassland ecosystem stability. Based on stakeholder requests for an easily available, online database we plan to present this map as an interactive Shiny web application [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 81" title="Easy web applications in R. &#xA;                    http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/&#xA;                    &#xA;                  .

This will invite easy exploration and access by both the public and scientific communities. The database will be hosted on an Amazon Web Services domain with the data queried and presented via Shiny (<a href="https://stuart-demmer.shinyapps.io/grassland-ecosystem-stability-systematic-map/">https://stuart-demmer.shinyapps.io/grassland-ecosystem-stability-systematic-map/</a>). Each of the four tables as well as a personalised dataset based on the user’s querying and filtering can be downloaded as a comma separated value or Microsoft Excel Workbook file from this web application. An option to include new articles to this database will be made available following the publication of the final systematic map. A note stating that these articles were not part of the original systematic map will be included for transparency. Adopting a live web-based repository to host the systematic map whilst allowing new articles to be added to the database will help ensure the continual relevance beyond the final systematic map publication.</p><p>A description of the review process, figures, tables, and bibliometric network analyses carried out using the ‘nails’ package (Network Analysis Interface for Literature Studies; [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 82" title="Knutas A, Hajikhani A, Salminen J, Ikonen J, Porras J.

An overview of the trends in experimental design will also be presented in a summarised form. The volume and key characteristics of the evidence base (descriptions on the environmental and methodological aspects of the studies, detailed summaries of identified driver-outcome relationships) will also be presented in the final report together with narrative discussions explaining the observed trends. Knowledge gaps will be identified and highlighted as future primary research topics and knowledge clusters will be proposed as future evidence syntheses topics.</p></div></div></section>
