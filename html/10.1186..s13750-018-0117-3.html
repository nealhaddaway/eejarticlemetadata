        <title>Can linear transportation infrastructure verges constitute a habitat and/or a corridor for insects in temperate landscapes? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes. A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis. Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had &#8220;control-impact&#8221; design, only two studies used &#8220;before-after-control-impact&#8221; design, and one study used &#8220;before-after&#8221; design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads. A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="Can linear transportation infrastructure verges constitute a habitat and/or a corridor for insects in temperate landscapes? A systematic review"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes. A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis. Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had “control-impact” design, only two studies used “before-after-control-impact” design, and one study used “before-after” design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads. A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness."/>

Up to now, the potential of linear transportation infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered. The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles, abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthesize results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements were used for a quantitative synthesis.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were included in our review. Almost all of them had “control-impact” design, only two studies used “before-after-control-impact” design, and one study used “before-after” design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastructures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodiversity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway road verges than in habitats away from roads.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as corridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.</p></div></div></section>

Yet, the potential of LTIs verges considered longitudinally, i.e. focusing on biodiversity dispersal flows parallel to LTIs, remains unclear. LTIs are generally made of a transportation lane (road, railway, pipeline, powerline, river or canal) and of verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines, or waterway banks, etc.). A verge is a strip along, between, above or below the carriageway(s), inside the LTI boundaries, not directly used for transportation and managed by the LTI owner. In most cases, verges are covered by vegetation and may potentially constitute semi-natural habitats. This vegetation can either be “natural”, dominated by exotic species or mono-specific. It is thus of interest to assess whether, despite their fragmenting effect, LTI verges could contribute longitudinally to a network of blue-green infrastructures and thus to biodiversity conservation.</p><p>At first sight, the studies that have considered LTI verges longitudinally seem to have provided contrasted results. For instance, according to Bolger et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 32" title="Bolger DT, Scott TA, Rotenberry JT.

In addition, a verge management practice can be beneficial for some species and detrimental for other ones [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Wagner DL, Ascher JS, Bricker NK.

Therefore, LTI managers and the French ministry in charge of the Environment requested a systematic review, taking into account all accessible studies and synthesizing their results. Such a review might be of interest to LTI managers and policy makers by identifying the conditions under which LTI verges could play a role of habitat and/or corridor for biodiversity. Previous reviews on the influence of one specific type of LTI on biodiversity have already been published [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 37" title="Trombulak SC, Frissell CA.

To date, no systematic review addressed the potential role LTIs may play on biodiversity as corridors or habitats.</p><p>In France, the concept of green infrastructures led to the development of a public policy project named “Trame Verte et Bleue” in 2007. This project was developed by the “Ministère de l’Environnement de l’Énergie et de la Mer” (MEEM, Ministry in charge of the environment). Accordingly, French administrative regions have identified ecological networks and are currently developing action plans for preserving and restoring these continuities. This issue has also to be considered in local urban planning. Through different spatial scales, various stakeholders work on the issue of habitat fragmentation.</p><p>As the LTI network is very dense in France, LTI managers might substantially contribute to ecological networks. For instance, the French road network, with over a million kilometer long, is the longest (¼ of the European network) and one of the densest (1.77 km/km<sup>2</sup>) of the European Union. As a comparison, Spain, which has an area close to the one of France, has a road density six times lower (0.32 km/km<sup>2</sup>). SNCF Réseau manages more than 30,000 km of railway lines in use (out of 50,000 km), which constitutes the longest railway network of Europe. Meanwhile, such a dense LTI network means a considerable inherent surface of verges. The total area of French road verges is indeed estimated to 4500 km<sup>2</sup>, thus superior to the total area of 3450 km<sup>2</sup> of the seven terrestrial national parks [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Conseil général de la Sarthe.

Accordingly, LTI verges could substantially contribute to green infrastructures. Aware of these issues, several French LTI managing companies have gathered in an informal group, named “Club des Infrastructures Linéaires &amp; Biodiversité” (CILB), aiming at acting for biodiversity conservation. Among the members of the CILB, motorway, railway, power line, pipeline and waterway French stakeholder companies<sup><a href="#Fn1"><span class="u-visually-hidden">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> decided to evaluate whether their LTI verges could contribute to blue-green infrastructures for improving the management of these verges for that purpose.</p><p>The systematic review was assumed to be a relevant scientific method for providing a sound answer to this practical questioning from LTI managers. The French ministry in charge of the environment undertook a call for tender for a systematic review. This call was developed through its research incentive program relative to transportation ecology, named “Infrastructures de Transport Terrestre, Écosystèmes et Paysage” (ITTECOP), with the help of the CILB and the “Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversité” (FRB), a French foundation supporting research in biodiversity.</p><p>The “Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle” (MNHN) was then chosen for conducting the project. The review team also gathered teams of the “Institut national de recherche en sciences et technologies pour l’environnement et l’agriculture” (Irstea), the University of Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC), the “Centre d’études et d’expertise sur les risques, l’environnement, la mobilité et l’aménagement” (Cerema) and of the “Institut national de la recherche agronomique” (Inra).</p><p>The protocol of the systematic review which covers all the kinds of biodiversity has previously been published [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Jeusset A, Vargac M, Bertheau Y, Coulon A, Deniaud N, Flamerie De Lachapelle F, et al.

The review first lists the relevant studies in a database. We then used narrative syntheses to summarize the evidence about the potential of LTI verges as corridors or habitats for insects and the influence of verge management and surrounding landscape.

Thus, it combined both of them with the Boolean operator “OR” hoping that articles about unlisted outcomes were found by the use of a verge synonym and conversely.

At each stage, in case of uncertainty, we retained articles for assessment at the following stage. Articles about non insects species were put aside during the workflow of title, abstract and full-text screenings.</p><p>At each stage, article eligibility was based on a list of selection criteria. At the title screening stage, these criteria encompassed both the subject (ecology and related disciplines) and the population of the article (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Tab4">4</a>). The same criteria were used at the abstract screening stage, to which we added criteria regarding the exposure/intervention, the comparator, the outcomes or the study type (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Tab5">5</a>). Articles without abstract were excluded. Finally, the same criteria as for the abstract stage were used for the full-text screening stage, to which we added inclusion/exclusion criteria specific to the full-text stage regarding the language, the climate, the type of publication or the specific questions covered (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Tab6">6</a>).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-4"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab4" data-test="table-caption">Table 4 List of exclusion/inclusion criteria at the stage of title screening</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3/tables/4"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec15">Grey literature</h4><p>Grey literature, which does not comply with scientific publishing standards, was assessed on title and full-text (with the same criteria as those listed above for published literature). Ph.D. theses were first screened to determine their eligibility. Each potentially relevant chapter/article was then treated separately as a unique full-text.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16">Test of consistency of reviewers’ inclusion/exclusion decisions</h3><p>Before the onset of screening, the reviewers taking part in the assessment process tested the consistency of their inclusion/exclusion decisions. For each of the sets of articles about waterways and other LTIs and for each of the title and abstract screening stages, we randomly selected a sample of articles and each of the reviewers screened them independently of each other. As more than two reviewers took part in each article inclusion assessment, we computed Randolph’s Kappa coefficients in R 3.3.2 [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="R Core Team.

A coefficient of 0.6 was set as the minimal acceptable level of estimated agreement between reviewers. When the coefficient was lower than 0.6, reviewers in disagreement discussed until choosing common selection criteria. Then, they re-tested the consistency of their inclusion/exclusion decisions on a new set of articles and computed Randolph’s Kappa coefficients. This operation was repeated until reaching a coefficient superior to 0.6. The final scores ranged from 0.667 to 0.780 (mean = 0.740). We performed this test of consistency on the articles obtained from Web of Science Core Collection publication database, which was the first database processed. We did not repeat this process for the Zoological Records publication database, but since the same reviewers performed both database screenings, we are confident on the consistency of their inclusion/exclusion decisions.</p><p>Although it is good practice to perform a test of consistency of reviewers’ inclusion/exclusion decisions at the full text stage we were unable to do this due to logistical constraints and time limitation.</p><p>We took care that reviewers never had to screen or critically appraise articles they authored by themselves.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17">Moderators potentially accounting for heterogeneity in the insect responses to LTI verges</h3><p>We recorded the following potential effect modifiers as stated in the protocol of the present review [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Jeusset A, Vargac M, Bertheau Y, Coulon A, Deniaud N, Flamerie De Lachapelle F, et al.

Accordingly, those articles without replicates were discarded during critical appraisal.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18">Study validity assessment</h3><p>In order to develop the critical appraisal of the studies included following full-text screening, eight external experts in landscape connectivity and transportation ecology and seven scientists of the review team were gathered and consulted during a 1-day workshop [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Jeusset A, Vargac M, Bertheau Y, Coulon A, Deniaud N, Flamerie De Lachapelle F, et al.

During the workshop, we discussed the gold standard protocol of an ideal study answering our primary question with unlimited resources. The criteria used to assess the relevance and the susceptibility to bias were based on these discussions.</p><p>We considered that a study was not relevant to the purpose of the review, and thus discarded it, if:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>the comparator was inappropriate (comparison between different seasons, comparator difficult to interpret for the purposes of this review, etc.),</p></li><li><p>the results included biological groups and/or exposures that were not under the scope of the review, with no possibility to extract results scoping the review (e.g. results combining insects and non-insects: macro-invertebrates, results combining paths and paved roads).</p></li></ul>
<p>Since we checked data redundancy (data already published in another article included in the review) during critical appraisal, we added this factor as an exclusion cause, although it is not strictly a quality criterion.</p><p>We considered that a study was unreliable because of a high susceptibility to bias, and therefore excluded it from the review, if there was:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>a total absence of replications,</p></li><li><p>an inadequate methodology (for example for question #4: statistical analysis of movement data that did not allow to distinguish LTI verges from other habitats),</p></li><li><p>a method description strongly insufficient (i.e. when it is not possible to know where the sampling was done: within or without LTI verges),</p></li><li><p>major confounding factors.</p></li></ul>
<p>We considered the studies that had the characteristics detailed below as having medium susceptibility to bias:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>absence of transparent and systematic procedure for the selection of sample plot location (i.e. randomization, fixed distances, grids),</p></li><li><p>comparator-intervention and before-after-intervention study designs (as opposed to before-after-comparator-intervention study designs) for the specific questions involving verge management (questions 1 and 3),</p></li><li><p>absence of true spatial replication of the study (for example study with repetition of measures on a unique site),</p></li><li><p>attrition bias (difference in the loss of samples between control and treatment),</p></li><li><p>method description slightly insufficient (some minor details were missing but did not challenge our understanding of the methods).</p></li></ul>
<p>Studies that were not considered to have high and medium susceptibility to bias were considered to have low susceptibility to bias.</p><p>For articles dealing with more than one specific question (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Tab1">1</a>), we performed critical appraisal for each question separately, that we considered being different studies.</p><p>The critical appraisal was performed as follows: first, each study was critically appraised by one reviewer. Then, a second reviewer critically appraised again the uncertain cases. We compared conclusions of the two reviewers, and when they differed, they discussed disagreements until reaching a consensus and asked for a third reviewer if necessary.</p><p>Studies that did not display any statistical comparison between treatments and controls were included in the review.

Only the statistically tested results were included. For each species or group of species, we extracted the effects of exposure/intervention and categorized them as positive, negative or neutral. Neutral effects referred to comparison between control and treatment that were statistically non-significant, i.e. there was no difference between the two.

As specific inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, in addition to those used for the whole review, primary studies had to report mean, sample size and some measurement of variation for insect abundance or species richness for both LTI and another habitat away from LTI serving as control. In details, insect species richness, abundance and its proxies (density, number of burrows/mounds, but not occurrence) were used as response variables in the meta-analyses. In each primary study, for both LTI verges and control sites away from LTIs, we extracted sample sizes, outcome means, and measures of variation (standard deviation, standard error, variance or confidence interval) from tables, text, published raw data (e.g. in appendices), data provided to us by the authors, and graphs (using Get-Data Graph Digitizer 2.26). In addition, when measures of variance were missing, they were either recalculated from raw data, retrieved from statistical test values, or estimated via data imputation [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Lajeunesse MJ, Koricheva J, Gurevitch J, Mengersen K.

Finally, we tested moderators related to (4) the design of the studies in order to check for potential biases.</p><p>We used five LTI categories (1): railways, pipelines, power lines, waterways, highways and other roads. We discriminated highways from non-highway roads because road width, verge width and disturbances (traffic, noise, light, pollution) can vary considerably between the two types.</p><p>In addition to LTI type, we recorded the contrast between LTI verge and the compared habitat as a potential moderator (2). The contrast was considered as low when the vegetation types were roughly similar (e.g. grassy verges compared to grassland, meadow, natural open vegetation), as medium when grassy verges were compared to arable field, and as high when the vegetation types were dissimilar (e.g. grassy verges vs. forest stands).</p><p>To evaluate whether heterogeneity in insect response to LTI could be accounted for by species-specific traits (3), we assigned individual species and groups of species to a trophic level (primary consumers—e.g. herbivores, pollinators, secondary consumers—e.g. predators and omnivorous). Scavengers were classified as secondary consumers and insects consuming dead wood and dead plant as primary consumers. In addition, we extracted habitat preference for each individual species of butterflies, bees, bumblebees, ground beetles and ants. We encoded habitat preference in three categories: generalist, specialist of open habitats and specialist of forest habitats.

We nested the study cases within the studies as random effects for each analysis, which allowed effect size estimates to vary not only owing to sampling error, but also owing to biological or environmental differences between organisms and studies. A study case referred to an individual effect size extracted from a study (e.g. abundance of a particular insect species); a given study possibly gathering multiple study cases (e.g. abundance of several insect species).</p><p>Under a mixed model, the weight assigned to each effect size (w*) was set as the inverse of the sum of two variance components w* = 1/(w + τ<sup>2</sup>), where w (= 1/se<sup>2</sup>) was the unique sampling variance for each study (within-study error) and τ<sup>2</sup> was the estimated pooled variance of the true effects across all studies (between-studies variance).</p><p>In a first step, we computed the grand mean effect size for each response variable (i.e. abundance and species richness) by combining data from all LTIs and species. Additionally, the data sets were analyzed for publication biases using funnel plots, plots of the mean cumulative meta-analysis by publication year (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#MOESM8">8</a>), and the fail-safe number modified by Rosenberg [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Rosenberg MS.

We restricted our analyses to categorical moderators that ensure at least two studies in each resulting categories. Thus, in some cases, we either combined similar categories to increase the sample size or deleted the categories that did not meet the sample size criteria. In particular, we combined pipelines and power lines to overcome small sample sizes, and because these two LTIs have similar verges (i.e. strips of grass or shrub under power lines and above buried pipelines).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-8"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab8" data-test="table-caption">Table 8 Candidate moderators by category</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3/tables/8"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>
<p>Concerning the abundance, we tested the “habitat specialization” effect comparing models with and without interaction terms with AIC and Anova. We did not use the AIC corrected for small sample size (AICc) because the sample sizes were large enough in regards to the numbers of parameters of the models. We tested (1) the interaction between habitat specialization and trophic level for the subset of data on highways (the only LTI with enough data), and (2) the interaction between habitat specialization and LTI type for the subset of data on pollinators (the only trophic level with enough data). The “forest specialist” category was discarded as it only gathered five cases. Given the absence of statistically significant interaction in both cases (the AIC of the model with interaction was not lower by 2 points or more than the AIC of the model without interaction), the “habitat specialization” factor was not taken into account in further meta-analyses. We pooled all species irrespective of their habitat specialization for subsequent analyses.</p><p>We evaluated the effect of the trophic level on the abundance of insects for each LTI type separately (see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Fig7">7</a>). Despite the large number of cases for abundance (N = 661), their distribution between moderator categories prevented us to run a model using the conservation status of each species as moderator (N pest/invasive = 2, see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#MOESM7">7</a>). In a last step, we checked if contrast between verges and compared habitats did not affect our results by testing the interaction between habitat contrast (low/medium vs. high) and trophic level for the subset of data on highways (the only LTI with enough data).</p><p>For species richness, the uneven distribution of effect sizes and their small number (N = 48) prevented us to evaluate the effect of trophic level. We were thus unable to move further beyond evaluating the effect of LTI type.</p><p>For all data analyses, total heterogeneity, Q<sub>T</sub>, was partitioned into heterogeneity explained by the model, Q<sub>M</sub>, and heterogeneity not explained by the model, Q<sub>E</sub> (i.e. Q<sub>T</sub> = Q<sub>M</sub> + Q<sub>E</sub>). The statistical significance of Q<sub>M</sub> and Q<sub>E</sub> were tested against a χ<sup>2</sup> distribution.</p><p>Because some case studies may not be fully independent as they came from the same primary study, we performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the main results (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#MOESM9">9</a>).</p><p>Meta-analyses were conducted in R 3.3.2 [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="R Core Team.

The grey literature call provided only 6 other documents and one article was only retrieved on Google Scholar. Ten of the articles were in French, the other ones in English. The most common type of document was scientific journal articles (N = 84), 4 Ph.D. chapters, 2 technical reports and one MSc report were also included.</p><p>Among the 104 included studies (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#MOESM4">4</a>), 31 studies evaluated the effect of verge management on insect biodiversity (question #1) and 55 studies compared insect biodiversity in verges to the one of other habitats (question #2). No study dealt with the influence of verge management on insect dispersal (question #4), neither with the influence of surrounding landscape on dispersal along the verges (question #6).

<p>The language criteria (English or French) used during screenings and the dominant nationality of the panel of experts contacted can explain the high number of studies conducted in France. Indeed, 8 of the 18 studies conducted in France belonged to documents written in French, and we collected 7 of these 8 studies through our call for grey literature.</p><p>The oldest retrieved study included in this review was published in 1972. Altogether a global increase in the number of studies can be observed along the decades (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Fig5">5</a>a).</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-5"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig5" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 5</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3/figures/5" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-018-0117-3/MediaObjects/13750_2018_117_Fig5_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-5-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-018-0117-3/MediaObjects/13750_2018_117_Fig5_HTML.gif" alt="figure5" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-5-desc"><p>Year of publication of the studies that addressed our six specific questions (<b>a</b>), and LTIs under study for our specific questions (<b>b</b>).

<p>Roadside verges were by far the most studied type (N = 65), followed by waterway banks (N = 30), railway embankments (N = 7), power line (N = 6) and pipeline verges (N = 1). The specific question that compares insect biodiversity along and away from LTI verges focused disproportionately on roads (44 among 58 studies, question #2 Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Fig5">5</a>b), and the only studies about insect dispersal focused on road verges. On the contrary, waterway banks gathered more than half studies about the effect of management practices on insect biodiversity (19 among 32 studies, question #1 Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Fig5">5</a>b).</p><p>Coleoptera and butterflies were the most studied taxa (N = 47, Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Fig6">6</a>). Sixteen studies focused on composite groups: on one side, studies on invertebrates or arthropods that include insects, and on the other side, studies on insects without precision about which insects the study dealt with. Ants were investigated by 13 studies and bees and/or bumblebees by 10 studies. The other taxa were, among others, Odonata, Diptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera and Heteroptera.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-6"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig6" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 6</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3/figures/6" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-018-0117-3/MediaObjects/13750_2018_117_Fig6_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-6-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-018-0117-3/MediaObjects/13750_2018_117_Fig6_HTML.gif" alt="figure6" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-6-desc"><p>Taxonomic insect groups of the included studies.

<p>Among the outcomes, more than 3/4 of the studies used measures related to abundance (abundance, density, occurrence, frequency, patch occupancy…), of group or individual species. Nearly 2/3 of the studies presented indices of species richness (species richness, Shannon, Simpson, Hill, evenness index, Piélou equitability…). Nearly 1/3 of the studies used indices of similarity or dissimilarity between communities (Jaccard, Sørensen, Renkonen indices, Bray–Curtis dissimilarity…), and the same proportion focused on community composition (species traits, feeding guilds, relative abundance…).</p><p>Of the 104 included studies, 101 had a control/intervention or control/exposure design, two studies had a BACI design and the remaining one had a before/after design.</p><p>Details about the studies (language, specific question addressed, country, biological group, LTI, study design, outcomes, susceptibility to bias etc.) are available in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#MOESM4">4</a>.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec29">Data synthesis and presentation</h3><p>For each specific question, we first began with a narrative synthesis of the studies and summarized key results in a table. The lack of studies, or the broad variation in the type of investigations conducted, prevented us from using formal meta-analytical techniques for the questions 3, 4, 6 and 1, 5 respectively.</p><p>For the specific question gathering the most retained articles, i.e. question #2 (Habitat in LTI verges vs. at proximity), both narrative synthesis and meta-analyses were conducted. The narrative synthesis provides the context and background for the quantitative meta-analyses. In addition, some of the articles, which did not provide suitable data to be included in the meta-analyses, presented results that can be included in a narrative synthesis. The meta-analyses especially focus on LTI types and species traits (trophic level and habitat preference), and go deeper than the narrative synthesis on these aspects. Thus, the narrative synthesis and the meta-analyses are complementary, both providing a different perspective.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30">Narrative syntheses</h3><p>The narrative syntheses of secondary review questions were based on 63 studies out of the 104 included studies.

Technical constraints that challenge the studies of insect movements are not the only factor responsible for these gaps. Indeed, if the small body size of the insects has so far precluded the use of most radio-tracking equipment, it is still possible to evaluate their dispersal through mark-recapture method, genetic analysis or direct observation. There is a number of studies that evaluated insect movements near LTIs [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 124" title="Eycott AE, Stewart GB, Buyung-Ali LM, Bowler DE, Watts K, Pullin AS.

The positive to neutral effect we found for management practices that aim to restore a more “natural” vegetation along verges is of conservation interest for LTI owners. The positive effect is driven by studies where management practices consisted in getting rid of exotic invasive plants species along waterways. We were not able to draw a general trend for the effect of grazing and mowing of the LTI verges on insect biodiversity. More studies are needed to conclude on these vegetation management practices and advise those that favor insect biodiversity.</p><p>Previous reviews focused on the comparison of animal abundance near LTIs and in other habitats.

Indeed, pollinators and primary consumers are more abundant in non-highway roadsides than in habitats away from LTIs whereas their abundances do not differ between highway roadsides and controls. The difference between small and large roads might be explained by the positive correlation between traffic volume and insect collisions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Muñoz PT, Torres FP, Megías AG.

However, long-term studies of population dynamics are missing to disentangle potential ecological traps from actual positive effects of non-highway road verges on insect abundance [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 129" title="Rytwinski T, Fahrig L.

The negative effect of land uses related to human pressure (i.e. urbanization and agriculture) and the positive effect of forests and (protected) natural habitats in the surroundings concur with the “habitat amount hypothesis” supported by Fahrig [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 130" title="Fahrig L. Rethinking patch size and isolation effects: the habitat amount hypothesis.

Indeed, urbanization and agriculture development around LTI verges reduce the amount of suitable habitats at the landscape scale and, consequently, the insect species pool able to colonize the verges. The opposite process is true for undisturbed (or less disturbed) natural habitats that increase habitat availability and the presence of source populations.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec44">Reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>One of the main reasons for heterogeneity is the variety of comparators used among studies within each of our six specific questions. Indeed, the studies that compared insect biodiversity between LTI verges and habitats in proximity differ regarding the amount of contrast between the two habitats; for example in terms of resources used by the insects. Similarly, the type of management practices also greatly influences the carrying capacity of LTI verges. For instance, the effect of invasive plant removal along roadsides would greatly differ from the effect of mowing. Thus, we grouped studies that focused on the same kind of management. Nevertheless, there was still a large amount of heterogeneity between the interventions (e.g. various mowing regimes).</p><p>Similarly, there was a wide range of designs, landscape metrics and spatial scales used in studies that evaluated the influence of the surrounding landscape on the biodiversity hosted by the LTI verges.</p><p>In addition, the type of LTI studied and the type of LTI verge are important sources of variation. For instance, waterways and power lines present major differences in terms of transportation, physical properties, shapes, vegetation type of their verges and hence, species hosted. The LTI verges also differ in their management, use, history, width, etc. Therefore, their quality and carrying capacity for insect populations are not homogeneous even among LTI verges of a given type.</p><p>Another non-negligible cause of disparity between the results of the studies is the variety of species in terms of biology, ecology, physiology and functional traits. Indeed, insects encompass a wide range of taxa, from aquatic caddisflies, major pollinators, to agricultural pests such as some aphids. Each species or taxonomic group has its own requirements, and as a result, a management practice favoring species with certain traits could be detrimental for other species.</p><p>In the meta-analyses, the variation in effect sizes observed most likely reflects the differences between LTI types and the ecological requirements of the taxa. Unfortunately, the small number of studies together with the scarcity in the description of the LTIs, LTI verges and studied habitats, did not allow us to conduct quantitative examination of the influence of environmental conditions at both verges and compared habitats, or variables related to LTI characteristics. Thus, we were not able to go deeper in the prospection of the reasons for heterogeneity.</p><p>Lastly, as metrics of biodiversity, species richness and abundance suffer from a kind of blindness as they consider all the species to be equal. To overcome this limitation, we tested the effect of trophic level and habitat specialization. Unfortunately, we were not able to analyze the effect of species conservation status, and a quantitative evaluation of the difference in species composition was beyond the objective of this review.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec45">Review limitations</h3><p>Most of the studies included in the map are based on data collected within 1 or 2 years, with very few long-term studies. For insects, which can be subject to extreme inter-annual population variations, this deficiency can limit the conclusions of individual studies. In addition, there are few highly replicated large scale experiments, providing increased robustness and reliability of the results. Some studies focused on very restricted areas and did not include a true spatial replication of LTI verges. Therefore, their conclusions are context-dependent and difficult to extrapolate to other areas. Moreover, only some of the studies included in this review incorporate data collection before the intervention. This can be problematic, especially to evaluate the influence of management practices, because it is not possible to distinguish real management effect from pre-existing differences between control and managed sites. Moreover, besides the limitations of the individual studies included in this review, we note a lack of common research protocol for each specific question. Indeed, researchers measured several aspects of insect biodiversity in dissimilar ways, which challenges the comparison of results among studies.</p><p>Our systematic review focuses on the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges for insects, therefore, for aquatic linear structures our objective was to only select articles on navigable waterways. Nevertheless, navigability of the waterways is rarely provided by authors and there is not international database that references this information. Thus, we applied inclusion/exclusion criteria (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Tab6">6</a>) that sound relevant to restrict included articles to major waterways, implicitly assuming that they might be navigable. We are aware that this solution is not perfect: some articles about navigable waterways could have been excluded and others about non-navigable waterways could have been included. In addition, it is quite tricky to distinguish study sites within waterway verges from those out of the verges. Contrary to the other LTIs, the concept of verge for a waterway can be ambiguous because of the fluctuation of the water level throughout seasons. As a consequence, we recommend authors to add these indications in their study site description.</p><p>We limited our narrative syntheses to the comparisons that were statistically tested. This restriction led us to put aside some grey literature documents without statistics, as well as some results from old scientific articles for which we were not sure that the comparisons provided were statistically tested. Likewise, papers comparing more than two categories, which do not provide results for each comparison (Kruskal–Wallis test, Anova or linear regression without post hoc tests), challenged our ability to include them. In several studies, particularly older ones, statistically non-significant results are often not shown, possibly inducing publication bias. However, in the meta-analyses, fail-safe numbers indicated that our results were sufficiently robust. Another issue stems from the studies that evaluate the effects of multiple landscape metrics simultaneously, using model selection in additive regression (this is the case for two of the studies [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Moroń D, Skórka P, Lenda M, Rożej-Pabijan E, Wantuch M, Kajzer-Bonk J, et al. Railway embankments as new habitat for pollinators in an agricultural landscape.

Indeed, because of the collinearity between metrics, a landscape variable that is not retained in the best model does not necessarily have no effect. To properly test the effect of each landscape metric, it would have been necessary to compare the null model with the corresponding univariate model.</p><p>For 5 of our 6 specific questions, the small number of articles and the diversity of the studies we captured limited our ability to implement meta-analyses. For that reason, we reviewed the evidence using narrative syntheses. However, narrative syntheses cannot provide reliable information on the magnitude or consistency (homogeneity) of the results of the studies. In addition, when sample size and magnitude are low and variability is high, the studies are unable to detect a real response, thus narrative syntheses are more prone to negative bias because the ability to detect real effects is limited [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 68" title="Gurevitch J, Curtis PS, Jones MH. Meta-analysis in ecology. Adv Ecol Res. 2001;32:199–247." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#ref-CR68" id="ref-link-section-d55439e4857">68</a>]. Consequently, the conclusions we provided for these questions should be taken with caution, and we recommend more research on these topics to allow meta-analyses in the future.</p><p>Our meta-analysis for species richness was based on a limited number of study cases in comparison to the meta-analysis for abundance (N = 48 and N = 661 respectively). At the same time, the grand mean effect size was twice as high for the species richness as for the abundance (d = 0.269 and d = 0.174 respectively). Consistent with our findings that publication bias is unlikely to affect our conclusions, differences in effect-sizes between richness and abundance is likely ecologically relevant and we hypothesize that a higher number of primary studies reporting data on species richness may allow us to detect a statistically positive grand mean effect size for species richness as primary studies will accumulate.</p><p>For abundance, some of the meta-analyses that we conducted were based on a limited number of studies, in particular when evaluating the effect of trophic level. Together with the uneven distribution of the effect sizes between moderator categories, it precluded the investigations of the influence of habitat specialization and of the contrast between verges and controls in a proper hierarchical approach. Moreover, we were unable to further investigate the influence of the contrast between LTI verges and habitats away from LTIs in terms of food and nesting resources or abiotic factors, because there was not enough information reported within studies to do so.</p><p>To save time during screening, we decided to exclude articles that did not provide any abstract. This is not consistent with CEE guidelines which recommend including them in the full text assessment. We acknowledge that this can be a potential source of bias. However, a first examination of a sample of these documents showed that the publication type was unsuitable for all of them (editorial, letter, review, policy recommendation, meeting report…), so that they would have been eventually excluded in subsequent steps.</p><p>Although it is good practice, we were unable to test the consistency of reviewers’ inclusion/exclusion decisions at the full text stage due to logistical constraints and time limitation. Thus, despite clarifications and adjustments between reviewers before the full text assessment, an observer effect at the full text stage might be a potential source of bias in our review.</p><p>The language restriction we applied (French and English), biased the studies towards English and French speaking countries. However, we do not believe that the geographic bias created by the language restriction would bias the outcomes of our review as linear transportation infrastructure verges are essentially the same across the temperate zone.</p><p>Roads encompass 40 out of the 63 studies included in the narrative syntheses and 416 out of the 709 effect sizes extracted for the meta-analyses. The under-representation of the LTIs other than roads limits the relevance of our systematic review for these LTIs. Moreover, the taxonomic bias restricts the conclusions we can draw for taxa other than Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Rhopalocera. Finally, because it focused on insects, we would like to emphasize that this review only represents a partial estimate of the potential of LTI verges as habitat and corridor for biodiversity. Therefore, we highlight the importance of broadening the review of evidence to other taxonomic groups such as plants and vertebrates, and to climatic regions different from the temperate area.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec46"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec46-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec46">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec46-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec47">Implication for policy/management</h3><p>Overall, the evidence is too weak to inform policy or management with specific detailed recommendations on the concrete questions LTI managers have about their infrastructures. For example, evidence was too small and scattered to answer the following questions: “Can LTI verges serve as movement corridor for pollinators?” or “What type of river embankment favors insect biodiversity?”.</p><p>However, some key results can inform policy makers and LTI managers. First, LTI verges are not “deserts”. They can harbor similar to higher insect biodiversity than habitats away from LTIs. Thus, this result gives another perspective for LTI managers: LTIs are not always detrimental for biodiversity, in certain conditions they can contribute to biodiversity conservation. Given the large amount of LTI verges, especially in Western Europe, policy makers should consider these landscape elements in biodiversity conservation politics. This advice concurs with the “land sharing” paradigm, which considers the potential of all land uses in biodiversity conservation and reconciles nature and human activities [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 131" title="Kremen C.

It complements “land sparing” politics where biodiversity conservation is restricted to small protected areas [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 131" title="Kremen C.

Favoring the use of natural material in the verges, preserving the natural functioning of the ecosystem, and promoting/preserving the development of native vegetation instead of exotic or mono-specific vegetation along verges are sensible general pieces of advice.</p><p>Finally, we showed that insect biodiversity hosted by LTI verges depends on the landscape context. In consequence, LTI managers should take this effect into account when choosing where to dedicate special efforts for biodiversity conservation.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec48">Implication for research and monitoring</h3><p>In regards to the research gaps we highlighted, we advise to dedicate resources on the monitoring of insect movements along LTI verges. These studies are crucial to evaluate if insects can benefit from LTI verges as corridors, and if management practices or landscape context are likely to affect the corridor effectiveness. In addition, it is necessary to devote more efforts on LTIs other than roads, especially on railways, power lines and pipelines (proportionally to their cumulative length). Moreover, scientists should focus on other insect groups than Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Muñoz PT, Torres FP, Megías AG.

Indeed, if LTI verges might support less abundant and diverse insect communities in human modified landscapes (urban or agricultural), they can constitute the last relict of degraded semi-natural habitats and refuges for wildlife. To investigate this aspect, it will be necessary to compare the contribution of LTI verges in the total landscape biodiversity (gamma diversity) along a land-use intensity gradient.</p><p>Finally, we provide some suggestions to improve study standardization and data reporting:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>clearly define the LTI verges (vegetation type, management, resources, adjacent habitat, landscape context, history) and clearly define the habitats compared to the LTI verges (Questions # 2 and 4) and if possible evaluate the contrast between LTI verges and habitats away from verges in terms of vegetation type and quality (resource availability).</p></li><li><p>be very clear in “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-018-0117-3#Sec6">Methods</a>” section on how the experiment was done (study duration, time since construction of the LTI, type of replication, sampling location: distance from the LTI and the adjacent habitat …).</p></li><li><p>include more information in table and figure capti<b>o</b>ns (such as the number of replicates that the means are based on, and the type of variation that is shown).</p></li><li><p>present all results, even statistically non-significant ones (in appendix if necessary).</p></li><li><p>make raw data available (appendix or deposition in public data repositories).</p></li><li><p>include information about species requirement and biology (habitat specialization, trophic level, dispersal capacity, conservation status, etc.)</p></li><li><p>increase the study duration, the number of true spatial replicates and the spatial extent of the studies.</p></li><li><p>favor data collection before the intervention when studying the effect of management practices (BACI, BAI designs).</p></li><li><p>if possible, adopt a gradient approach to investigate variations in response to management intensity (e.g. mowing frequency).</p></li></ul>

                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">Funding and support</h3>
                <p>The project was supported by three organizations: the CILB, the MEEM and the FRB. It was funded by the CILB, which is composed of the following LTI managing organizations: Réseau Ferré de France (now named SNCF Réseau), Voies Navigables de France, Réseau de Transport d’Électricité, GRT Gaz, Transport et Infrastructures Gaz France and Électricité Réseau Distribution France (now ENEDIS), EIFFAGE and Association des Sociétés Françaises d’Autoroutes. Besides, the MEEM and ADEME (Agence de l’environnement et de la maîtrise de l’énergie) supported the project through the ITTECOP program which constituted a framework for the project, offered a partial financial contribution to the project and provided funding through the Cerema participation. Finally, the FRB gave the research team methodological support for the realization of the systematic review.</p>
              
                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">Candidate selection</h3>
                <p>The MNHN was selected by the CILB, the ITTECOP and the FRB to conduct the systematic review following a public call for projects, for which the MNHN had submitted a proposal.</p>
              
                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">Project course</h3>
                <p>The ITTECOP was met once by RS and AJ to present the first stages of the project and ask for directories of experts of transportation ecology. LTI managing organizations, the ITTECOP and the FRB were met twice by RS, AJ, MV, JT, AC, YB, SV during the course of the project to expose them the progress of the project. LTI managing organizations funding the project were also met once before the redaction of the present manuscript, by RS, AJ and MV, in order to clarify their needs for information and the inherent scientific question.</p>
                <p>The FRB, through its representative Barbara Livoreil, had a particular role in the first stages of the project as it is a backer of the project, a member of the research team and a representative of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence, which approves environmental systematic reviews. Nevertheless, the role of the FRB in the decisions made by the research team remained advisory and the present document was proofread by independent peer-reviewers.</p>
                <p>All project decisions regarding the design, the collection, the analysis and the interpretation of data were made freely by the authors of the study. All statements made in this report are under the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the CILB or of the ITTECOP.</p>
                <p>The review manuscript was sent to the funding body for information when submitting it for publication.</p>
              
                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading">Other projects</h3>
                <p>After responding to a call for tender, the MNHN was selected to conduct another project than the present one, named Trans-fer, which was also funded by Réseau Ferré de France (a member of the CILB) and the MEEM. Trans-fer ended before the beginning of the present project and the two projects were steered independently.</p>
