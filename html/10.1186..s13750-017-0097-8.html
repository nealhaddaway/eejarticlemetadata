        <title>Response of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems: a systematic review protocol | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a major stressor across the globe. Despite recognition by scientists and stakeholders of the problems of nutrient pollution, rigorous synthesis of scientific evidence is still needed to inform nutrient-related management decisions, especially in streams and rivers. Nutrient stressor-response relationships are complicated by multiple interacting environmental factors, complex and indirect causal pathways involving diverse biotic assemblages and food web compartments, legacy (historic) nutrient sources such as agricultural sediments, and the naturally high spatiotemporal variability of lotic ecosystems. Determining nutrient levels at which ecosystems are affected is a critical first step for identifying, managing, and restoring aquatic resources impaired by eutrophication and maintaining currently unimpaired resources. The systematic review outlined in this protocol will compile and synthesize literature on the response of chlorophyll a to nutrients in streams, providing a state-of-the-science body of evidence to assess nutrient impacts to one of the most widely-used measures of eutrophication. This review will address two questions: &#8220;What is the response of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems?&#8221; and &#8220;How are these relationships affected by other factors?&#8221;
                         Searches for published and unpublished articles (peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed) will be conducted using bibliographic databases and search engines. Searches will be supplemented with bibliography searches and requests for material from the scientific and management community. Articles will be screened for relevance at the title/abstract and full text levels using pre-determined inclusion criteria; 10% (minimum 50, maximum 200) of screened papers will be examined by multiple reviewers to ensure consistent application of criteria. Study risk of bias will be evaluated using a questionnaire developed from existing frameworks and tailored to the specific study types this review will encounter. Results will be synthesized using meta-analysis of correlation coefficients, as well as narrative and tabular summaries, and will focus on the shape, direction, strength, and variability of available nutrient-chlorophyll relationships. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression will be used to evaluate potential effects of study quality and modifying factors on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a major stressor across the globe. Despite recognition by scientists and stakeholders of the problems of nutrient pollution, rigorous synthesis of scientific evidence is still needed to inform nutrient-related management decisions, especially in streams and rivers. Nutrient stressor-response relationships are complicated by multiple interacting environmental factors, complex and indirect causal pathways involving diverse biotic assemblages and food web compartments, legacy (historic) nutrient sources such as agricultural sediments, and the naturally high spatiotemporal variability of lotic ecosystems. Determining nutrient levels at which ecosystems are affected is a critical first step for identifying, managing, and restoring aquatic resources impaired by eutrophication and maintaining currently unimpaired resources. The systematic review outlined in this protocol will compile and synthesize literature on the response of chlorophyll a to nutrients in streams, providing a state-of-the-science body of evidence to assess nutrient impacts to one of the most widely-used measures of eutrophication. This review will address two questions: “What is the response of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems?” and “How are these relationships affected by other factors?” Searches for published and unpublished articles (peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed) will be conducted using bibliographic databases and search engines. Searches will be supplemented with bibliography searches and requests for material from the scientific and management community. Articles will be screened for relevance at the title/abstract and full text levels using pre-determined inclusion criteria; 10% (minimum 50, maximum 200) of screened papers will be examined by multiple reviewers to ensure consistent application of criteria. Study risk of bias will be evaluated using a questionnaire developed from existing frameworks and tailored to the specific study types this review will encounter. Results will be synthesized using meta-analysis of correlation coefficients, as well as narrative and tabular summaries, and will focus on the shape, direction, strength, and variability of available nutrient-chlorophyll relationships. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression will be used to evaluate potential effects of study quality and modifying factors on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships."/>

Despite recognition by scientists and stakeholders of the problems of nutrient pollution, rigorous synthesis of scientific evidence is still needed to inform nutrient-related management decisions, especially in streams and rivers. Nutrient stressor-response relationships are complicated by multiple interacting environmental factors, complex and indirect causal pathways involving diverse biotic assemblages and food web compartments, legacy (historic) nutrient sources such as agricultural sediments, and the naturally high spatiotemporal variability of lotic ecosystems. Determining nutrient levels at which ecosystems are affected is a critical first step for identifying, managing, and restoring aquatic resources impaired by eutrophication and maintaining currently unimpaired resources. The systematic review outlined in this protocol will compile and synthesize literature on the response of chlorophyll <i>a</i> to nutrients in streams, providing a state-of-the-science body of evidence to assess nutrient impacts to one of the most widely-used measures of eutrophication. This review will address two questions: “<i>What is the response of chlorophyll</i> a to <i>total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems?”</i> and <i>“How are these relationships affected by other factors?”</i>
                        </p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches for published and unpublished articles (peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed) will be conducted using bibliographic databases and search engines. Searches will be supplemented with bibliography searches and requests for material from the scientific and management community. Articles will be screened for relevance at the title/abstract and full text levels using pre-determined inclusion criteria; 10% (minimum 50, maximum 200) of screened papers will be examined by multiple reviewers to ensure consistent application of criteria. Study risk of bias will be evaluated using a questionnaire developed from existing frameworks and tailored to the specific study types this review will encounter. Results will be synthesized using meta-analysis of correlation coefficients, as well as narrative and tabular summaries, and will focus on the shape, direction, strength, and variability of available nutrient-chlorophyll relationships. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression will be used to evaluate potential effects of study quality and modifying factors on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships.</p></div></div></section>

We define TN as the sum of ammonia N, nitrate N, nitrite N, and organic nitrogen forms; we define TP as the sum of dissolved and particulate phosphorus forms.</p><p>Comparator: Control group (no added TN or TP, or low exposure to TN or TP) (for experimental studies), or comparison to lower or higher TN or TP concentrations across a gradient (for observational studies).</p><p>Outcome: Chl-a concentration (sestonic or benthic).</p><p>The secondary question addressed by this review is: <i>How are the relationships identified in the primary question affected by other factors?</i> An initial list of potential modifying factors is provided below (see “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0097-8#Sec3">Methods</a>” and “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0097-8#Sec17">Potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity</a>”); others may be added as studies are examined in more detail.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec3"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec3-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec3">Methods</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec3-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Search strategy</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec5">Search terms and filters</h4><p>Bibliographic databases will be searched using a combination of terms representing the nutrient stressors (TN or TP), the biological response (chl-a), and habitat- or study-specific terms (e.g. terms associated with types of lotic fresh waters and experimental stream studies) (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0097-8#Tab1">1</a>).

The majority of studies of nutrient stressor-response relationships examine biotic responses across field sites with varying nutrient concentrations, although some compare “reference” to “impacted” sites or experimentally manipulate nutrient concentrations. Most studies will thus use correlation or regression to assess relationships between nutrients and chl-a. The shape and direction (e.g. linear—increasing, linear—decreasing, logarithmic, exponential, sigmoidal) and strength of these relationships will form the basis for meta-analysis and narrative summary of the review results. In most instances, Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Spearman's rho (r) between TN or TP and chl-a will be used as the effect size. Other effect size measures (e.g. standardized slope coefficients: change in standard deviations of y associated with a change of one standard deviation of x [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Underwood AJ.
