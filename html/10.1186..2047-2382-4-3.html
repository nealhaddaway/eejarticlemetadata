        <title>What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review protocol | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60&#160;years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60&amp;nbsp;years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends."/>

PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends.</p></div></div></section>

                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Genesis of the systematic review</h3><p>A systematic review on PFASs in the environment was originally suggested by the Swedish Chemicals Agency at a general stakeholder meeting arranged by Mistra EviEM in January 2012, to which a broad spectrum of organizations were invited and encouraged to suggest topics for systematic reviews. The Swedish Chemicals Agency is responsible for the Swedish environmental quality objective “A non-toxic environment” [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 85" title="&#xA;                  The environmental objectives portal&#xA;                  &#xA;                    http://www.miljomal.se/Environmental-Objectives-Portal/&#xA;                    &#xA;                  &#xA;                " href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR85" id="ref-link-section-d121958e983">85</a>]. There is a growing concern in Sweden that continued discharges of PFASs may cause environmental as well as human health effects. Borg and Håkansson [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 86" title="Borg D, Håkansson H: Environmental and Health Risk Assessment of Perfluoroalkylated and Polyfluoroalkylated Substances (PFASs) in Sweden.

The result of the environmental risk characterization indicated a cause for concern for seals and otters for hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity. For reproductive toxicity in birds, a cause for concern was indicated for PFOS where the highest level in peregrine falcons eggs (sampled in 2006) exceeded the toxic effect level identified in a study by Molina <i>et al.</i>[<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 87" title="Molina ED, Balander R, Fitzgerald SD, Giesy JP, Kannan K, Mitchell R, et al.: Effects of air cell injection of perfluorooctane sulfonate before incubation on development of the white leghorn chicken (Gallus domesticus) embryo.&#xA;                  Environ Toxicol Chem 2006, 25:227–32. 10.1897/04-414R.1" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR87" id="ref-link-section-d121958e992">87</a>]. Regarding human health effects, at least three different municipal drinking water plants in Sweden have been shut down due to high concentrations of PFOS in the groundwater source. It is believed that the high concentrations are caused by spills of fire-fighting foam at adjacent airports or firefighting training sites.</p><p>A specific question regarding PFASs was not formulated at the general stakeholder meeting arranged by Mistra EviEM, but it emerged in later discussions with the Swedish Chemical Agency that increasing concentrations of short-chain substances such as PFBS have been observed [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 84" title="Glynn A, Berger U, Bignert A, Ullah S, Aune M, Lignell S, et al.: Perfluorinated alkyl acids in blood serum from primiparous women in Sweden: serial sampling during pregnancy and nursing, and temporal trends 1996–2010.&#xA;                  Environ Sci Technol 2012, 46:9071–9. 10.1021/es301168c" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR84" id="ref-link-section-d121958e998">84</a>], and that such trends are of great concern. There is a need to find out whether this is a local or global trend and whether similar trends have been observed for additional PFASs with recently increased production volumes.</p><p>Another stakeholder that Mistra EviEM has consulted is the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (SWAM), which is responsible for the Swedish environmental quality objectives “Flourishing Lakes and Streams” and “A Balanced Marine Environment, Flourishing Coastal Areas and Archipelagos”. Even though SWAM’s major interest in this topic is the toxic effects, the Agency is also interested in more information on sources, transportation processes and environmental fate of PFASs in general.</p><p>Since the consultations resulted in several conceivable review questions, the main stakeholders and a few scientists were invited to a discussion where the goal was to find a common ground and agree on the most relevant question. It was concluded that there is little or no controversy regarding the properties of PFCAs and PFSAs; they are in many cases persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) and some of them are classified and treated as such. It is however less clear how new compounds with shorter carbon chains should be treated. Even though they may be toxic and extremely persistent they may not be bio-accumulative enough to be classified as PBT-compounds or vPvB compounds. The Swedish Chemicals Agency needs more information on the environmental fate of both phased-out and replacement compounds. To compile and evaluate that information is not necessarily an easy task since, e.g., the results in monitoring studies can appear to be somewhat contradictory. In some cases one particular compound has shown opposite temporal trends in different sample types even within the same region.</p><p>In order to make the review as relevant as possible to as many people as possible, a wider group of Swedish stakeholders were invited to discuss what the review should focus on. This group of stakeholders included governmental agencies, municipal drinking water producers, environmental consultants and NGOs. Some of the key points put forward at the meeting included</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                    <li>
                      <p>PFOS and PFOA are the two most important phased-out substances, but their precursors are also important. Among replacement substances, the most toxic (if that is known) should be prioritized.</p>

                <p>One additional stakeholder that Mistra EviEM has consulted is the FluoroCouncil, which is a global organization representing a range of different fluoro-technology companies that manufacture, formulate or process fluoropolymer products, fluorotelomer-based products, fluoro-surfactants, and fluoro-surface property modification agents. The FluoroCouncil is involved in the 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program, a global partnership between U.S. EPA and industry based on voluntary goals to eliminate PFOA from facility emissions and product content by 2015.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Objective of the review</h3><p>Although compounds such as PFOS and PFOA have been phased out in some parts of the world, for many reasons it cannot be taken for granted that this will lead to swift declines in environmental or human exposure. If new emissions of a PFAS were to cease, the high persistence of PFCAs and PFSAs may lead to delayed and very slow declines in exposure. In addition, existing environmental burdens of precursor substances (including fluorinated polymers) might continue to act as an indirect pseudo-source of PFCAs and PFSAs in the future, depending on their stability. Furthermore, continued production and use of these compounds in parts of the world where phase-out policies have yet to be implemented could influence human and environmental exposure in regions far from this production, owing to long-range transport or exporting of commercial products containing PFASs. An additional complication is the vast spatial heterogeneity of current PFCA and PFSA burdens in the world’s oceans. For example, despite all recent regulatory actions (Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#Fig1">1</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#Fig2">2</a>), remote marine ecosystems in the Arctic are predicted to receive increased exposure to PFOS and PFOA in the future as ocean currents slowly transport relatively contaminated ocean water from mid-latitudes northwards to remote regions where current ocean concentrations are lower [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 50" title="Armitage JM, Schenker U, Scheringer M, Martin JW, MacLeod M, Cousins IT: Modeling the global fate and transport of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and precursor compounds in relation to temporal trends in wildlife exposure.&#xA;                  Environ Sci Technol 2009, 43:9274–80. 10.1021/es901448p" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR50" id="ref-link-section-d121958e1069">50</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 88" title="Dietz R, Bossi R, Riget FF, Sonne C, Born EW: Increasing perfluoroalkyl contaminants in east Greenland polar bears (Ursus maritimus): a new toxic threat to the Arctic bears.&#xA;                  Environ Sci Technol 2008, 42:2701–7. 10.1021/es7025938" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR88" id="ref-link-section-d121958e1072">88</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Wania F: A global mass balance analysis of the source of perfluorocarboxylic acids in the Arctic ocean.&#xA;                  Environ Sci Technol 2007, 41:4529–35. 10.1021/es070124c" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR89" id="ref-link-section-d121958e1075">89</a>]. With all these complexities, uncertainties, and global spatial heterogeneity, it is difficult to predict the future of human and environmental exposure to PFASs. For this reason, an objective and systematic review of temporal trends reported in the literature was deemed a high priority.</p><p>In summary, PFCAs and PFSAs have unique environmental chemistry and much of the environmental fate of substances within these groups is still poorly understood. The objective of the proposed systematic review is to find out whether the concentrations of these substances in the environment are changing in any particular direction, and whether any spatial differences or changes in temporal concentration trends can be related to the implemented phase-outs. In addition, any temporal changes in the distribution of linear vs branched perfluoroalkyl chains for individual PFCAs and PFSAs will be explored to determine if isomer pattern changes can be associated with the phase-outs.</p><p>The review team has phrased the review question as “<i>What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment?</i>” The question builds on the following elements:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">

Consequently, measured concentrations are in most studies not directly related to any particular phase-out. In fact, useful time trends may even be found in studies where the purpose of the study was completely unrelated to any phase-out of PFASs at all. This means that studies qualified for the systematic review will not be restricted to intervention studies, but will potentially include any study reporting on at least one temporal PFAS concentration trend. Since it is known when and where the interventions have been implemented it may be possible to relate these to the changes in concentrations, and hence, intervention should still be a justified question element.</p><p>Relevant temporal trends may be obtained by recurring measurements at a given location (monitoring) or by means of environmental archives (e.g. dated sediment cores, ice cores) or specimen banks (e.g. biota, human diet, human samples). There will be no geographic limitations. However, to be included in the systematic review, the articles must pass each of the following relevance criteria.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                    <li>
                      <p>Relevant population or subject: abiotic and biological samples, including general human populations, exposed to ambient loads of PFASs and their precursors. Populations with occupational exposures related to manufacturing of PFASs, or with deliberate exposures in controlled trials, will be excluded.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p>Types of outcome: time trends in concentrations of PFASs covering at least two years. Ideally the studies should provide concentration data from both before and after an intervention. In that case it is possible to compare the concentrations before and after the intervention. This is however not a prerequisite for inclusion in the systematic review since there are other means of evaluating temporal trends (see section Data synthesis and presentation).</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <p>At the title and abstract level all retrieved articles will be screened by two reviewers. To check that the screening is consistent and complies with the agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria, a small subset (10%) of the retrieved articles will also be double screened by the other reviewers. In case it cannot be decided whether the article should be included or excluded on the title and abstract level, the article will pass to the full text level. To evaluate the consistency of the screening, Kappa tests will be used. When screening at the full-text level the articles will be screened in the same manner as at the title and abstract level. A subset of at least 10% of the articles will be double screened. Again, Kappa tests will be used to test the consistency between the reviewers. If any Kappa test shows unacceptable discrepancies (κ &lt; 0.6) the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be revisited by all reviewers and defined in a more unambiguous way. At both title/abstract and full text levels, excluded articles will be coded with a reason for exclusion. A list of all articles excluded at full text screening, with reasons for exclusion, will be provided in the systematic review.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9">Potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>The outcome may to a large extent be a function of time, and one obvious factor influencing the outcome is the timing of the study relative to the interventions. A study with data from just a few years directly after the intervention is likely to show a smaller effect than a more recent study covering a longer study period.</p><p>Although the interventions are intended to have a global impact, the outcome may for several reasons vary considerably depending on the location of the studies. Since the interventions are not yet implemented globally, it is reasonable to assume that the effect will be smaller in regions close to present sources compared to regions close to past sources where the interventions have been implemented.</p><p>Contaminated areas may also be a significant factor. In areas where the phase-out has been implemented, contaminated areas may still be present and leaching the phased-out substances to the surrounding environments.</p><p>In more remote regions, such as the Arctic, the outcome may depend on the predominating mode of transport. In terrestrial or high-altitude areas where the PFAS source is dominated by long-range transport of volatile precursors, the response to the interventions may be quicker compared to coastal areas where the PFAS source is dominated by direct long-range transport in the aquatic environment. The measured outcome may also depend on sample type.</p><p>Food web dynamics, e.g. temporal shifts in diet and/or growth rates over the time-scale of decades, can influence long-term temporal trends of persistent organic contaminants. For example, in the northern Baltic Sea, herring have been shown over the long term to grow more slowly which is related to shift in feeding at one trophic level higher than they did in the past.

Among studies of human samples, the results may vary between cross-sectional studies, where different people are studied every year, and prospective/longitudinal studies, where the same individuals are followed over time.</p><p>Analytical quality may also be a reason for heterogeneity. In the early years standards were not always available for accurate calibration of the analytical instruments. Both accuracy and precision have been improved in recent years, and the detection limits for PFASs were in general 100 times higher in 2000 than in 2014. The ability to distinguish between linear and branched perfluroalkyl chains and to analyse a wider range of substances have helped to improve our understanding of heterogeneities between studies.</p><p>In summary, potential effect modifiers and reasons for heterogeneity may include:</p><ul class="u-list-style-none">

                <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Study quality assessment</h3><p>During critical appraisal of relevant studies, information that directly affects the internal validity of each study will be recorded in a pre-designed Excel spreadsheet. The assessment of the internal validity will focus on the following aspects:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet">
                    <li>
                      <p>Selection bias. In this case the comparison groups are formed by samples taken at different times. The information about samples and what they represent must be sufficient to determine whether samples from different sampling occasions are comparable.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Dating of samples. In most cases it is known when samples are collected, but samples from environmental archives such as sediment or ice cores are more complicated to date accurately. Dating by means of e.g. isotope techniques that give an absolute age to each individual sample may be regarded as high quality dating. Dating by means of historical markers (e.g. peak concentrations of other contaminants) providing relative ages may be regarded as acceptable dating. Post-depositional perturbations caused by for instance thawing-freezing cycles in snow or bioturbation in sediments should be discussed and assessed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Sample integrity. Are sample pre-treatment, sample preservation, prevention of contamination and storage methods suitable for the sample type?</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>Analytical quality. Are analytical procedures appropriate? Did instrumentation, internal standards, procedural blanks, LOD/LOQ or field blanks change over time? If so, what is the risk that these parameters have influenced the measured temporal trends?</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                <p>Study length and sampling frequency will be recorded but will generally not be part of the regular quality assessment since these parameters presumably will be reflected by the standard errors and confidence intervals of the effect sizes in each study. Study length and sampling frequency will thus affect the weighting of each study in the quantitative synthesis. The number of individual or pooled samples will also be recorded. Standard errors are likely to be smaller in studies with multiple and individually analysed samples at each sampling occasion than studies with just one sample from each time point. A high number of pooled samples at each sampling occasion may increase the chance of obtaining results representative for these time points and may therefore decrease the scatter along a regression line. In this way the number of pooled samples is also likely to affect the weighting of each study in the quantitative synthesis.</p><p>Information important for the assessment of external validity, or how transferable the studies are to the context of the question, will be recorded as well. As indicated by the study inclusion criteria, relatively few restrictions regarding populations/subjects and geographical locations will be applied. The external validity is therefore mainly related to subgroup analysis that will be performed. Information about environmental setting and important sample covariates should be reported to such an extent that each study confidently can be grouped with other studies or be judged to stand alone. Also, the study should cover a time period that is possible to relate to any known relevant phase-out.</p><p>Relevant studies that are judged to have low risk for selection bias, have accurately dated samples, ensured good sample integrity, have used appropriate analytical procedures, and provide sufficient information regarding external validity will meet the quality criteria and hence be included in the quantitative synthesis. Any reason for not including a study based on quality will be recorded in the data spreadsheet and a list of all articles excluded during critical appraisal, with reasons for exclusion, will be presented in the systematic review. However, studies that fail to qualify for the quantitative synthesis will be used in sensitivity analyses where it will be tested if the inclusion or exclusion of these studies influence the overall results.</p><p>Critical appraisal of relevant studies will be carried out by four of the reviewers. To ensure a high consistency between the reviewers at least 25% of the relevant articles will be double-checked and Kappa tests will be used to test the consistency. In addition to this, any articles that for some reason are difficult to critically appraise will be discussed by the entire review team before any decisions are made.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec11">Data extraction strategy</h3><p>Data (concentrations and other important study information) will be extracted from relevant studies and recorded in pre-designed Excel data sheets. Information directly relevant to the internal validity of the studies will be extracted and recorded by the reviewers that carry out the critical appraisal, while the rest of the data will be extracted and recorded by two other reviewers. However, the design of the data extraction sheets and how they should be filled will be approved in advance by all reviewers, and double-checking by all reviewers will be done for at least 25% of the articles. Data will always be recorded as reported in the primary studies. All necessary transformations and calculations will be performed at the analysis stage.</p><p>The outcome data that will be recorded is the PFAS concentrations in the studied samples at different times and/or slopes of trends during specified time periods. The location of these data within each article, as well as an indication whether the data have been graphically extracted from figures, will be recorded. The types of data that will be compiled include sample type (air, sediment, species etc.), matrix (filter, 2 cm slice, liver, dissolved vs total water etc.), number of pooled or individual samples, covariates (sampling time, age, sex etc.), statistical variates (concentrations, slope of trend, linear-non-linear etc.), geographical location, time period covered, number of years covered. Data extraction may include contact with individual scientists for complementary information or for raw data or unpublished data.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec12">Data synthesis and presentation</h3><p>Meta-analyses for each PFAS will be performed using random effect models [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 92" title="Borenstein M, Hedges LV, Higgins JPT, Rothstein HR: Introduction to meta-analysis.&#xA;                  John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd; 2009." href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#ref-CR92" id="ref-link-section-d121958e1965">92</a>]. One possible effect size will be based on average concentrations during specified periods before and after the implementation of an intervention, respectively. All studies do however not use the same scale. Different units for concentration are used for different sample types (e.g. water and sediment), and different sample types show different concentration levels depending on the partition coefficient between the sample types. Different units for concentration may also be used for a certain sample type. For example, the concentrations in sediment samples are sometimes given as ng/g bulk sediment and sometimes as ng/g TOC (Total Organic Carbon). All of this means that raw differences in average concentrations cannot be used as effect size. Therefore response ratios will be used as the effect size. The response ratio R is calculated according to equation <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="equation anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-4-3#Equ1">1</a>, where <img src="//media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F2047-2382-4-3/MediaObjects/13750_2014_63_IEq1_HTML.gif" alt="" /> and <img src="//media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F2047-2382-4-3/MediaObjects/13750_2014_63_IEq2_HTML.gif" alt="" /> are the average concentration during a specified period before and after the implementation of the intervention, respectively.

                </div></div>
                <p>Another effect size that will be explored is the normalized rate of change in concentration. It is possible that even though there is no significant difference in average concentrations, there can be a significant trend in some direction after the intervention. Moreover, although the evidence for a causal relationship between the outcome and the intervention will be weaker, the rate of change in concentration can be evaluated when pre-intervention data is missing or when more than one intervention influence the outcome. This means that also non-intervention studies can be included. The rate of change will be calculated by means of regression analyses. Again, since different scales are used in different studies, the rate of change needs to be normalized. If the rate of change is normalized to the average concentration before the intervention the effect size C’ is calculated as

                  <sub>0</sub> is concentration at time t = 0. It may also be possible to compare the normalised rates of change in concentration before and after the intervention, respectively, if that data exist.</p><p>Obviously, with such a wide range of subjects or populations that potentially can be included in the systematic review it will be necessary to perform subgroup analyses. It is envisaged that for each PFAS analysed, the splitting into subgroups will be based on e.g. sample type, species and geographical region. A narrative synthesis will be prepared using tables of study characteristics and results. Visualisation of results may be done using forest plots and other graphical representations.</p></div></div></section>
