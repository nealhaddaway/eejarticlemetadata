        <title>Can interventions that aim to decrease Lyme disease hazard at non-domestic sites be effective without negatively affecting ecosystem health? A systematic review protocol | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported, broadly distributed vector-borne disease of the northern temperate zone. It is transmitted by ticks and, if untreated, can cause skin, cardiac, nervous system and musculoskeletal disease. The distribution and incidence of LD is increasing across much of North America and Western Europe. Interventions to decrease exposure to LD hazard by encouraging behavioural change have low acceptance in high risk groups, and a safe, effective human LD vaccine is not presently available. As a result, habitat level interventions to decrease LD hazard itself (i.e. levels of infected ticks) have been proposed. However, some interventions may potentially negatively affect ecosystem health, and consequentially be neither desirable, nor politically feasible. This systematic review will catalogue interventions that aim to reduce LD hazard at non-domestic sites, and examine the evidence supporting those which are unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health. The review will be carried out in two steps. First, a screening and cataloguing stage will be conducted to identify and characterise interventions to decrease LD hazard at non-domestic sites. Secondly, the subset of interventions identified during cataloguing as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health will be investigated. In the screening and cataloguing step literature will be collected through database searching using pre-chosen search strings, hand-searching key journals and reviewing the websites of public health bodies. Further references will be identified by contacting stakeholders and researchers. Article screening and assessment of the likely effects of interventions on ecosystem health will be carried out independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer will be consulted if disagreements arise. The cataloguing step results will be presented in tables. Study quality will then be assessed independently by two reviewers, using adapted versions of established tools developed in healthcare research. These results will be presented in a narrative synthesis alongside tables. Though a full meta-analysis is not expected to be possible, if sub-groups of studies are sufficiently similar to compare, a partial meta-analysis will be carried out."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported, broadly distributed vector-borne disease of the northern temperate zone. It is transmitted by ticks and, if untreated, can cause skin, cardiac, nervous system and musculoskeletal disease. The distribution and incidence of LD is increasing across much of North America and Western Europe. Interventions to decrease exposure to LD hazard by encouraging behavioural change have low acceptance in high risk groups, and a safe, effective human LD vaccine is not presently available. As a result, habitat level interventions to decrease LD hazard itself (i.e. levels of infected ticks) have been proposed. However, some interventions may potentially negatively affect ecosystem health, and consequentially be neither desirable, nor politically feasible. This systematic review will catalogue interventions that aim to reduce LD hazard at non-domestic sites, and examine the evidence supporting those which are unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health. The review will be carried out in two steps. First, a screening and cataloguing stage will be conducted to identify and characterise interventions to decrease LD hazard at non-domestic sites. Secondly, the subset of interventions identified during cataloguing as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health will be investigated. In the screening and cataloguing step literature will be collected through database searching using pre-chosen search strings, hand-searching key journals and reviewing the websites of public health bodies. Further references will be identified by contacting stakeholders and researchers. Article screening and assessment of the likely effects of interventions on ecosystem health will be carried out independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer will be consulted if disagreements arise. The cataloguing step results will be presented in tables. Study quality will then be assessed independently by two reviewers, using adapted versions of established tools developed in healthcare research. These results will be presented in a narrative synthesis alongside tables.

It is transmitted by ticks and, if untreated, can cause skin, cardiac, nervous system and musculoskeletal disease. The distribution and incidence of LD is increasing across much of North America and Western Europe. Interventions to decrease exposure to LD hazard by encouraging behavioural change have low acceptance in high risk groups, and a safe, effective human LD vaccine is not presently available. As a result, habitat level interventions to decrease LD hazard itself (i.e. levels of infected ticks) have been proposed. However, some interventions may potentially negatively affect ecosystem health, and consequentially be neither desirable, nor politically feasible. This systematic review will catalogue interventions that aim to reduce LD hazard at non-domestic sites, and examine the evidence supporting those which are unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>The review will be carried out in two steps. First, a screening and cataloguing stage will be conducted to identify and characterise interventions to decrease LD hazard at non-domestic sites. Secondly, the subset of interventions identified during cataloguing as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health will be investigated. In the screening and cataloguing step literature will be collected through database searching using pre-chosen search strings, hand-searching key journals and reviewing the websites of public health bodies. Further references will be identified by contacting stakeholders and researchers. Article screening and assessment of the likely effects of interventions on ecosystem health will be carried out independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer will be consulted if disagreements arise. The cataloguing step results will be presented in tables. Study quality will then be assessed independently by two reviewers, using adapted versions of established tools developed in healthcare research. These results will be presented in a narrative synthesis alongside tables. Though a full meta-analysis is not expected to be possible, if sub-groups of studies are sufficiently similar to compare, a partial meta-analysis will be carried out.</p></div></div></section>

Where there is a disagreement between reviewers a third independent reviewer will be consulted. The meaning of the concept of ecosystem health has long been contested [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Lackey RT. Values, policy, and ecosystem health. Bioscience. 2001;51:437–43." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0074-7#ref-CR60" id="ref-link-section-d35678e1129">60</a>]. For this review, the following summary outline will be used: ‘healthy ecosystems retain vigour (productivity), resilience (capacity to recover from disturbance, indeed self-renewal), and their organization (e.g., biodiversity and symbiotic relations between species)’ [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Wilcox BA, Aguirre AA, Horwitz P. Ecohealth: connecting ecology, health, and sustainability. In: Aguirre AA, Ostfeld RS, Daszak P, editors. New directions in conservation medicine: applied cases of ecological health. New York: Oxford University Press; 2012. p. 17–32." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0074-7#ref-CR61" id="ref-link-section-d35678e1132">61</a>]. By this definition anthropogenic change has degraded many or most ecosystems in which humans are at risk of contracting LD. Never the less, it is anticipated that some interventions may further negatively affect ecosystem health. Forms will be developed for this step with pre-chosen evaluation criteria to judge the likely effect of interventions on: (i) vigour (measured as activity, metabolism or primary productivity), (ii) ecosystem resilience (measured in terms of a system’s capacity to maintain structure and function in the presence of stress), and (iii) organisation (assessed as diversity and number of interactions between system components). See Rapport et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Rapport DJ, Costanza R, McMichael AJ. Assessing ecosystem health. Trends Ecol Evol. 1998;13:397." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0074-7#ref-CR62" id="ref-link-section-d35678e1135">62</a>] for further elaboration and examples of ecosystem health assessments. All forms will be available as an appendix to the report.</p><p>The cataloguing section of the report will include two tables. One will list those interventions assessed as likely to negatively affect ecosystem health. It will include a brief description of each intervention, a list of citations where it was proposed or trialled (full details in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0074-7#MOESM1">1</a>), and a justification of the assessment. A second table will list those interventions assessed as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health, and will likewise include a brief description, a justification of assessment, and a list of citations. In both tables justifications will reference evidence regarding the effect of interventions on ecosystem health, where such evidence exists. Where it does not, justifications of assessments of likelihood will cite examples of the effects of similar interventions.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec31">Systematic review</h4><p>The systematic review will investigate the subset of interventions that would be unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health, and determine their effectiveness at reducing LD hazard. As illustrated in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-016-0074-7#Fig1">1</a>, eligible literature will be assessed for study quality. The results will be presented in narrative, alongside tables. Given the considerable heterogeneities across studies indicated by the scoping search a full meta-analysis is not expected to be possible. However, if sub-groups of studies are sufficiently similar to enable comparison a partial meta-analysis of the data will be carried out. A table will show the data on supporting evidence for each of the interventions that were assessed as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health. It will include for each study involved the habitat, study type, outcome statistics and study quality grading. This table and the associated narrative synthesis will answer the primary research question: which interventions to decrease Lyme disease hazard at non-domestic sites are unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health and what evidence exists to support their effectiveness?</p></div></div></section>
