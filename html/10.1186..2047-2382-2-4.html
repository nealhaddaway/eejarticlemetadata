        <title>Evaluating the biological effectiveness of fully and partially protected marine areas | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) encompass a range of protection levels, from fully protected no-take areas to restriction of only particular activities, gear types, user groups, target species or extraction periods. We synthesized the results of empirical studies that compared partially protected areas (PPA) to (i) no-take marine reserves (NTR) and (ii) to open access areas (Open), to assess the potential benefits of different levels of protection for fish and invertebrate populations. A systematic search for relevant articles used terms describing MPAs, the biota (e.g. fish, invertebrates) and measures (e.g. density, biomass) of interest. Articles were examined for relevance using specified inclusion criteria. Included articles were appraised critically; the influence of studies whose effect of protection was identified to be confounded by habitat was examined by running a sensitivity analysis parallel to the main analysis that included all studies. Random effect meta-analysis on ln-transformed response ratios was used to examine the response to protection. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to explore variation in effectiveness in relation to MPA and species covariates. Synthesis of available evidence suggests that while PPAs resulted in higher values of biological metrics (density and biomass) than unprotected areas, greatest benefits were apparent in NTR areas when NTRs and PPAs were compared. For fish, the positive response to protection, whether full or partial protection, was primarily driven by targeted fish species. Although positive benefits were also apparent in non-target fish species, the results were more variable, perhaps because of fewer studies focusing on this group. Invertebrate studies were underrepresented and those available focused mainly on scallops, lobsters and sea urchins. Among the targeted species groups, benefits from partial protection relative to fished areas were highest for scallops, whereas benefits from full relative to partial protection were highest for lobsters. The examination of fish and invertebrate response to protection in terms of species richness and length was hampered by small sample sizes. There was significant variability in the magnitude of response to protection among the MPAs included in this study. The factors determining such variation were generally unclear although the size and protection regime of the PPA explained some of this variability. The available evidence suggests that no-take reserves provide some benefit over less protected areas, nevertheless the significant ecological effects of partially protected areas relative to open access areas suggest that partially protected areas are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all extractive activities is not a socio-economically and politically viable option.

        <meta property="og:description" content="Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) encompass a range of protection levels, from fully protected no-take areas to restriction of only particular activities, gear types, user groups, target species or extraction periods. We synthesized the results of empirical studies that compared partially protected areas (PPA) to (i) no-take marine reserves (NTR) and (ii) to open access areas (Open), to assess the potential benefits of different levels of protection for fish and invertebrate populations. A systematic search for relevant articles used terms describing MPAs, the biota (e.g. fish, invertebrates) and measures (e.g. density, biomass) of interest. Articles were examined for relevance using specified inclusion criteria. Included articles were appraised critically; the influence of studies whose effect of protection was identified to be confounded by habitat was examined by running a sensitivity analysis parallel to the main analysis that included all studies. Random effect meta-analysis on ln-transformed response ratios was used to examine the response to protection. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to explore variation in effectiveness in relation to MPA and species covariates. Synthesis of available evidence suggests that while PPAs resulted in higher values of biological metrics (density and biomass) than unprotected areas, greatest benefits were apparent in NTR areas when NTRs and PPAs were compared. For fish, the positive response to protection, whether full or partial protection, was primarily driven by targeted fish species. Although positive benefits were also apparent in non-target fish species, the results were more variable, perhaps because of fewer studies focusing on this group. Invertebrate studies were underrepresented and those available focused mainly on scallops, lobsters and sea urchins. Among the targeted species groups, benefits from partial protection relative to fished areas were highest for scallops, whereas benefits from full relative to partial protection were highest for lobsters. The examination of fish and invertebrate response to protection in terms of species richness and length was hampered by small sample sizes. There was significant variability in the magnitude of response to protection among the MPAs included in this study. The factors determining such variation were generally unclear although the size and protection regime of the PPA explained some of this variability. The available evidence suggests that no-take reserves provide some benefit over less protected areas, nevertheless the significant ecological effects of partially protected areas relative to open access areas suggest that partially protected areas are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all extractive activities is not a socio-economically and politically viable option.

We synthesized the results of empirical studies that compared partially protected areas (PPA) to (i) no-take marine reserves (NTR) and (ii) to open access areas (Open), to assess the potential benefits of different levels of protection for fish and invertebrate populations.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>A systematic search for relevant articles used terms describing MPAs, the biota (e.g. fish, invertebrates) and measures (e.g. density, biomass) of interest. Articles were examined for relevance using specified inclusion criteria. Included articles were appraised critically; the influence of studies whose effect of protection was identified to be confounded by habitat was examined by running a sensitivity analysis parallel to the main analysis that included all studies. Random effect meta-analysis on ln-transformed response ratios was used to examine the response to protection. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to explore variation in effectiveness in relation to MPA and species covariates.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Synthesis of available evidence suggests that while PPAs resulted in higher values of biological metrics (density and biomass) than unprotected areas, greatest benefits were apparent in NTR areas when NTRs and PPAs were compared. For fish, the positive response to protection, whether full or partial protection, was primarily driven by targeted fish species. Although positive benefits were also apparent in non-target fish species, the results were more variable, perhaps because of fewer studies focusing on this group. Invertebrate studies were underrepresented and those available focused mainly on scallops, lobsters and sea urchins. Among the targeted species groups, benefits from partial protection relative to fished areas were highest for scallops, whereas benefits from full relative to partial protection were highest for lobsters. The examination of fish and invertebrate response to protection in terms of species richness and length was hampered by small sample sizes. There was significant variability in the magnitude of response to protection among the MPAs included in this study. The factors determining such variation were generally unclear although the size and protection regime of the PPA explained some of this variability.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The available evidence suggests that no-take reserves provide some benefit over less protected areas, nevertheless the significant ecological effects of partially protected areas relative to open access areas suggest that partially protected areas are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all extractive activities is not a socio-economically and politically viable option.</p><p>A glossary of terms is given in Appendix.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Registration number</h3><p>CEE-09-018</p></div></div></section>

In order to account for the systematic bias associated with baseline differences in reserve location, a sensitivity analysis was conducted parallel to the main analysis to examine the influence of including the ‘habitat-confounded studies’ on the overall magnitude and direction of the protection effect, and report the results for the sensitivity analyses when the two differed. ‘Habitat-confounded studies’ refer to those studies where habitat variation, in terms of features such as substratum type, substratum composition and complexity, rugosity and exposure, was reported to be significantly different for the locations studied inside and outside the MPA.</p><p>Whenever studies reported that the enforcement of protection was poor or deteriorating during the course of the study, that study was excluded from the analyses. Additionally, study reliability is dependent on the replication of sampling effort within the MPA (e.g. the number of transects or trawls undertaken) and on the number of MPAs sampled. The level of replication (sampling effort and number of MPAs included) was recorded for each study.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec13">Data extraction</h3><p>Data extraction was undertaken using a review-specific data extraction form given in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#MOESM2">2</a>. Abundance (including density and CPUE), biomass, length and species richness were treated as continuous variables. Measures of abundance were used to address questions of density differences, while biomass allowed understanding of the contribution made by larger individuals. Sample sizes, means and variance (or other variance measures including standard deviation, standard error, 95% confidence interval) values were extracted as presented from tables or within text. Data from figures were extracted using the data-extraction software TechDig v.2.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14">Potential effect modifiers</h3><p>Several MPA characteristics that might influence the response to protection among MPAs were recorded. These included protection regime within the MPA (i.e. activities permitted and restricted), MPA size (km<sup>2</sup>), geographical location, time between implementation of protection and survey (MPA age), habitat type and depth. When enforcement lagged behind the establishment date, the first year of enforcement was used as the first year of protection. MPA characteristics were extracted for both the NTRs and the PPAs separately. Methodological information such as total survey area (m<sup>2</sup>), survey method (e.g. strip transects, point counts, trawl hauls), the total number of species reported in the study and the distance between the PPA and the NTR and/or the Open area were also recorded.

When there was more than one sampling event after MPA establishment, the most recent sampling event, representing the longest duration of protection was used. This avoids analytical problems associated with temporal autocorrelation. Furthermore, averaging data collected after, for example 2&nbsp;years and 8&nbsp;years of protection might underestimate the effect of protection, since effectiveness of MPAs has been shown to increase with age of MPA [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Claudet J, Osenberg CW, Benedetti-Cecchi L: Marine reserves: size and age do matter.

However, when the data were collected within the same year (most frequently over different seasons) a composite effect size was used for subsequent analysis to eliminate any seasonal effects associated with the timing of sampling. Similarly, mean data presented for different depths within the same MPA were aggregated into a composite effect size and its variance (Composite <i>ES</i>

<p>The mean difference (D) between the protected and open access area was used as the effect size for species richness, as absolute change in the number of species would be more informative to policy makers and managers. Hence, using this effect size an increase from 1 to 2 was treated the same as an increase from 10 to 11.

For species richness, effect sizes were weighted based on the inverse of the natural logarithm of the total area surveyed in each study. Total survey area ranged between 0.004&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and 0.03&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for fish studies and between 6.4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and 70.08&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> for invertebrate studies. Since the likelihood of finding new species increases with the size of area surveyed, we regarded weighting by survey area instead by sample size and variance, as a more biologically meaningful weighting scheme for species richness.

Whilst the confidence interval (95% CI) quantifies the accuracy of the summary effect size, the prediction interval addresses the dispersion of the effect sizes around the ‘true effect’.

Based on the information extracted on the type of activities prohibited within the PPA, we divided partially protected areas into (i) ‘indiscriminate’ PPAs, if they prohibit fishing activities that are damaging to bottom habitats and non-target species (e.g. scallop dredging and bottom trawling) and (ii) ‘discriminate’ PPAs, if they prohibit activities which effect particular target species but not the surrounding environment (e.g. seine nets, long lines, spearfishing). Furthermore, based on information on the permitted activities inside the PPA, ‘discriminate’ PPAs were sub-divided into those that allow commercial or artisanal fishing from those that allow recreational fishing or fishing for domestic purposes only. This categorization serves as an indication of the intensity of use by the different user-groups permitted to fish in the PPA. We refer to these sub-categories as ‘commercial’ and ‘recreational’, respectively. Fishing practices permitted inside ‘indiscriminate’ PPAs were carried out on a commercial scale. Therefore, PPAs were categorized into three discrete groups based on their protection regime: (a) indiscriminate, commercial (IdC); (b) discriminate, commercial (DC); and (c) discriminate, recreational (DR) (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#MOESM3">3</a> for details on the ‘protection regime’ classification scheme). It was hypothesized that indiscriminate PPAs will exhibit smaller responses to protection than discriminate PPAs as habitat restoration will have to occur before some species’ populations can begin to recover. Additionally, the effect of protection for populations in DR was hypothesized to be greater than for those in DC PPAs.</p><p>A categorical mixed model meta-analysis comparing each of the three protection regime categories was carried out. Differences in effect sizes among categories were tested using Q<sub>M</sub> statistic, which partitions the total variance (of all categories about the grand mean effect size) into variance within categories and variance between categories (of category means about the grand mean) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Borenstein M, Hedges LV, Higgins JPT, Rothstein HR: Introduction to Meta-Analysis.

The total area surveyed inside and outside the MPA and the proximity between the MPA and the control sites were included to account for methodological variation among studies that may have a strong impact on the results obtained.</p><p>The relatively small numbers of MPAs did not permit the construction of models with multiple variables, therefore weighted simple mixed effects regression models were used throughout the analyses.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec20">Species-level analyses: exploitation status</h4><p>A considerable proportion of studies in our database presented mean and variance values for one or more individual species with different degrees of exploitation. We therefore included these studies in separate meta-analyses to determine the effect of (i) partial protection over no protection and of (ii) full protection over partial protection for target and non-target species. ‘Target species’ is taken to refer to those species that are primarily sought by the fishermen in a particular fishery and are the subject of directed fishing effort. This category was further subdivided into target species that were protected in both the NTR and the PPA (TP) and target species that were protected in the NTR but still allowed to be fished inside the PPA (TNP). ‘Non-target species’ denotes species for which fishing gear is not specifically set, although the possibility that these species are accidentally caught as by-catch cannot be ruled out.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Meta-analysis</h5><p>Individual species <i>ln</i>-transformed response ratios (Ln<i>RR</i>

When a species was absent either inside or outside the MPA (i.e. the density or biomass estimate was zero), the species was removed from the analysis. As the effect sizes of individual species within a MPA are unlikely to be independent of each other, a single effect size measure for each ‘exploitation status’ category within each MPA was generated to handle non-independence of data [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Raudenbush SW, Becker BJ, Kalaian H: Modeling multivariate effect sizes.

Only the TP and NT categories for fish density, biomass and length provided a big enough sample size for formal significance testing<sub>.</sub> Results from the two approaches were cross-checked and discussed when different.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec22">Potential correlates of response to protection</h5><p>As for the reserve-level analyses we examined the influence of a number of MPA characteristics on target species response to protection. As the overall response to protection was not significantly different between TP and TNP (see Results section Species-level analysis: Comparison of partial protection vs. no protection and Species-level analysis: Comparison of full vs. partial protection), we pooled the effect sizes from these two sub-categories so as to retain more power in the analysis through a bigger sample size. The sample sizes for the NT species category were too small to allow further analysis. The variables examined for the target species data were: (i) MPA age (years); (ii) size of the PPA (for comparison of PPA <i>vs.</i> Open), or alternatively, the size ratio of the NTR to the PPA (for comparison of NTR <i>vs.</i> PPA); (iii) PPA protection regime (for comparison of PPA <i>vs.</i> Open); and (iv) the proximity of the non-protected control sites to the PPA border (for comparison of PPA <i>vs.</i> Open), or alternatively, the distance between the borders of the no-take area and partially-protected area (for comparison of NTR <i>vs.</i> PPA). The distance of the NTR to the PPA was not examined for target species density as all the MPAs except for one were characterized by a zonation scheme, consisting of NTR and an adjacent PPA. Furthermore, the number of species pooled to calculate the effect size for each exploitation category was also examined because averages composed of large numbers of species may exhibit stronger positive responses due to the higher probability of including species that benefit from protection [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 73" title="Micheli F, Halpern BS, Botsford LW, Warner RR: Trajectories and correlates of community change in no-take marine reserves.

After the abstract inclusion stage 298 articles were included with an additional 75 articles from organizational searches and bibliographies. At full text a total of 62 studies were found to be relevant and provided data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Many studies were not included in the review because the studies lacked an adequate comparator (i.e. an open access area for PPA vs. Open comparison, and a partially protected MPA for NTR vs. PPA comparison), or studies compared no-take areas with open access areas only. Studies were excluded from full text inclusion when the ‘protection regime’ (i.e. the activities prohibited and/or allowed) within the MPA were not described clearly in the study, such that it was difficult to decide whether the MPA was a NTR or a PPA.

Studies of PPAs in soft sediment were under-represented compared to those carried out on hard substrata, and coral reefs were the most studied habitats (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig3">3</a>). In total, 49 MPAs provided data on fish species, and 25 MPAs for invertebrate species. Density and biomass were the most common measures for assessment of protection on both fish and invertebrate populations (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig4">4</a>A). The majority of MPAs were based on control-impact studies sampled only once (39%, n = 30) or on multiple occasions (34%, n = 26). BACI data were presented for 18% (n = 14) of the MPAs, however 64% (n = 9) of these MPAs were from the same study [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Walsh WJ, Tissot BN, Hallacher LE: A report on the findings and recommendations of effectiveness of the West Hawaii Regional Fishery Management Area.

Only 2 MPAs presented before-after data. Most studies were based on underwater visual transects (fish studies: 75%, n = 38; invertebrate studies: 48%, n = 12). Experimental trawl hauls were the second most common method used for fish studies (18%, n = 9), whereas point count methods that included techniques like baited pots, grabs and photographic techniques were the second most common method (36%, n = 9) for invertebrate studies.

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26">Description of studies used in <i>NTR vs. PPA</i> analysis</h3><p>The majority of MPAs (50%) were based in Europe, the remaining MPAs were mainly found in Australia and New Zealand (27%) (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig2">2</a>). These MPAs were commonly characterized by a zonation scheme, consisting of a no-take area where all extractive activities are prohibited and an adjacent buffer zone or partially protected area where some but not all extractive activities are prohibited. MPA age at the time of study ranged between 2 and 25&nbsp;years. The size of the NTR ranged between 0.13 and 74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and that for the PPA between 4.5 and 609.95&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. 44% (n = 8) of the studies for which the area of the NTR and the PPA were available, the size of the NTR was less than 10% that of the PPA. The NTR was larger than the PPA for only 2 MPAs. All studies were conducted on coral reefs, seagrass meadows or rocky reefs (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig3">3</a>). In total, 20 MPAs provided data on fish species, and 14 MPAs for invertebrate species. Density and biomass were the most common measures for assessment of protection on fish, whereas density was most studied for invertebrate populations (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig4">4</a>B). The majority of MPAs were based on after control-impact studies sampled only once (31%, n = 10) or on multiple occasions (59%, n = 19). BACI data were presented only for 2 MPAs. Most studies were based on underwater visual transects (fish studies: 63%, n = 15; invertebrate studies: 69%, n = 9), the remaining studies used point count methods such as stationary UVC, quadrats and baited underwater video camera. The full details on MPA characteristics, survey design and methodology, and taxa (fish, invertebrate) and metrics (density, biomass, length, species richness) measured for each MPA are given in Tables&nbsp;2a and 2b in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#MOESM5">5</a>.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Quantitative synthesis / Meta-analysis</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec28">MPA-level analyses: Comparison of partial protection vs. no protection</h4><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec29">Fish density and biomass</h5><p>Overall, fish density and biomass were significantly higher inside the PPA than in the Open area.

However, when the analysis was repeated excluding studies that reported an effect of habitat on the assessment of PPA efficacy (4/21 for density, Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig5">5</a>; 3/21 for biomass, Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig6">6</a>), the effect size for fish density was reduced from 1.4 to 1.22 times higher inside the PPA and was barely significant (<math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mml:mover accent="true">

The prediction interval indicated a large range of effect sizes (Prediction interval (PI) for density = −0.89 → 1.57, Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig5">5</a>; PI for biomass = −0.15 → 1.02, Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig6">6</a>). Hence, the meta-analysis suggests that in general PPAs increase fish density and biomass compared to Open areas but, there is a 29% and 19% possibility of finding lower fish density and biomass, respectively, in the PPA relative to the Open area.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-5"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig5" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 5</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4/figures/5" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F2047-2382-2-4/MediaObjects/13750_2012_Article_21_Fig5_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="figure-5-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F2047-2382-2-4/MediaObjects/13750_2012_Article_21_Fig5_HTML.jpg" alt="figure5" loading="lazy"></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-5-desc"><p>

<p>There was significant heterogeneity in the response of fish assemblages to protection among PPAs in our datasets (density: Q = 893.68, df = 20, p &lt; 0.0001; biomass: Q = 81.87, df = 20, p &lt; 0.0001) (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig5">5</a>, Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig6">6</a>). Several potential effect modifiers were tested in an attempt to explain the variability in effect sizes between studies.</p><p>To examine whether the response to protection was influenced by the type of fishing activities prohibited and permitted within the PPA, we conducted a categorical meta-analysis for the effect of ‘protection regime’ on fish assemblage. Of the six comparisons between PPAs and Open areas (three types of protection regime for each of density and biomass) only one (biomass for the ‘discriminate, commercial’ DC category) showed significantly higher biomass inside the PPA relative to the Open area (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig7">7</a>). Comparison of the response to partial protection among the three protection regime categories examined was not significantly different for fish assemblage density (sensitivity analysis: Q<sub>M</sub> = 0.63, df = 3, p = 0.73) or biomass (sensitivity analysis: Q<sub>M</sub> = 2.01, df = 3, p = 0.37). We emphasize however, that the results for this effect modifier on fish assemblage data should be interpreted with caution owing to the small number of PPA case-studies within each category, which reduces the robustness of the average effect size.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-7"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig7" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 7</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4/figures/7" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F2047-2382-2-4/MediaObjects/13750_2012_Article_21_Fig7_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="figure-7-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2F2047-2382-2-4/MediaObjects/13750_2012_Article_21_Fig7_HTML.jpg" alt="figure7" loading="lazy"></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-7-desc"><p>

<p>In spite of some significant differences in density and biomass between the protected and open access areas, the magnitude of response to protection was not significantly different among the three ‘exploitation status’ categories (TP, TNP, NT) (sensitivity analysis for density: Q<sub>M</sub> = 3.98, df = 2, p = 0.14; sensitivity analysis for biomass: Q<sub>M</sub> = 0.15, df = 2, p = 0.93).

<p>There was significant heterogeneity in the response of target fish species to protection among MPAs in our datasets (density: Q = 112.84, df = 19, p &lt; 0.0001; biomass: Q = 30.39, df = 12, p = 0.002). Several potential effect modifiers were tested in an attempt to explain the variability in effect sizes between studies. A categorical meta-analysis was conducted to examine if the response of target species to protection was influenced by the protection regime of the PPA. Density and biomass were significantly greater (on average twice as high) in the PPA that allows fishing on a recreational basis or for domestic use only (DR) compared to the Open area (density (main analysis): <i>LnRR</i>

<p>The biomass of target fish species inside the PPA showed a slight (~3%) but significant reduction relative to the open access area upon increasing the duration of protection (slope = −0.03, CI = −0.06 – 0.003, Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Tab8">8</a>, Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig11">11</a>).

<h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec39">Invertebrates: density, biomass, length</h5><p>As the response to protection (partial:open) is likely to be influenced by species characteristics (e.g. growth rate, larval dispersal potential, adult mobility), it would be inadequate to aggregate data across different invertebrate taxonomic groups with very different life history and ecological characteristics. Hence, the effect of protection was examined separately for each taxonomic group.

We have thus synthesized data for studies that have examined the effect of partially protected MPAs relative to open access areas to further increase our understanding of the potential value of those MPAs which strike a balance between allowing user access and achieving management and conservation measures. We found significantly higher density and biomass of fish inside the PPA relative to open access areas (Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig5">5</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Fig6">6</a>).

Almost certainly, the frequency and intensity of exploitation experienced by a species in a fishery will greatly influence the magnitude of response to protection from fishing. For example, reductions in the spawning stock biomass resulting from high levels of fishing mortality, reduces the ability of fish populations to recover after a population decline [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 79" title="Hutchings JA: Influence of population decline, fishing and spawner variability on the recovery of marine fishes.

Hence, the reduction or elimination of fishing mortality following the effective implementation of a MPA is expected to increase population density and biomass as stocks recover from exploitation. Indeed, we found that the positive response to protection in PPAs relative to Open areas was mainly driven by target species of commercial importance (Tables <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Tab4">4</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Tab5">5</a>).

We have accounted for this potential effect modifier by keeping target species that are protected by the PPA (TP) separate from those not entirely protected in the PPA (TNP) and found significantly higher fish biomass inside the PPA relative to the Open area only for TP species (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/2047-2382-2-4#Tab5">5</a>). Our analysis comparing PPAs to Open areas therefore suggests that well-managed PPAs with some restrictions on use are a valuable tool to counteract the decline of target populations, given that these are effectively protected under the protection regime in place.</p><p>Albeit, the higher benefits of PPAs over Open areas, we found greater benefits of protection in NTRs compared to PPAs.

One possible explanation for this discrepancy in protection effect between density and biomass is that the density of individuals is susceptible to stochastic recruitment events, such that the movement of juvenile fish across the no-take reserve boundary into the adjacent partially protected area may have resulted in the smaller magnitude of protection effect observed for fish density. The high positive response for fish biomass provides evidence towards the protection benefit of fully protected areas from size-selective fishing or accidental catch.

Additionally, benthopelagic species that rely on benthic invertebrates for their food might take longer to respond to protection as habitat recovery following disturbance by bottom-towed gear will have to occur before these species can begin to recover.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that increasing the size of the PPA, in particular above 1000 km<sup>2</sup>, reduced the effectiveness of partial protection relative to no protection for fish assemblages as well as for fish target species. This was somewhat surprising given that previous theoretical and empirical studies have shown that larger no-take reserves are more effective at increasing biodiversity and density of commercial species [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Claudet J, Osenberg CW, Benedetti-Cecchi L: Marine reserves: size and age do matter.

The size of the partially protected areas in the dataset comparing PPAs to Open areas ranged between 1.5 km<sup>2</sup> and 11980 km<sup>2</sup> and although a single instance of illegal fishing in a small PPA can have a more damaging effect than in a large PPA, it is more likely that the occurrence of illegal fishing is higher in large PPAs. This may explain the lower effectiveness of protection that we observed for partially protected areas over 1000 km<sup>2</sup> in size. Another possible explanation for results not conforming to expectation is the inadequacy of the sampling effort and replication. Among the studies included in our analysis, the majority (24 out of 27) surveyed an area equivalent to less than 1% of the total area of the PPA, raising issues about the representativeness of the observations for the entire MPA. The proportion of area surveyed for MPAs larger than 20 km<sup>2</sup> was only 0.1% of the MPA area, suggesting that the sampling in large MPAs may have inadequate power to detect subtle changes in density or biomass between the protected and unprotected areas.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec49">Key challenges met in this review</h3><p>Confounded baselines have been identified as barriers to the interpretation of MPA studies previously [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Mosquera I, Cote IM, Jennings S, Reynolds S: Conservation benefits of marine reserves for fish populations.

A first source of confounding emerges from the fact that habitat structure may not be comparable between the protected and unprotected areas. Some authors have argued that the apparent effect of protection is not due to protection per se, but rather due to higher-quality habitat before the onset of protection (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Willis TJ, Millar RB, Babcock RC: Protection of exploited fish in temperate regions: high density and biomass of snapper Pagrus auratus (Sparidae) in northern New Zealand marine reserves.

A strong-point of this meta-analysis is that we tried to minimize habitat bias on protection effect by running a sensitivity analysis alongside the main analysis, whereby studies with reported habitat differences between the protected and control area were excluded from the sensitivity analysis (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Miller R, Williams B, Duffy C: Reef fish of the Sugar Loaf Islands (Ngä Motu) Marine Protected Area, New Zealand.

The analyses have shown several instances when the outcome of the sensitivity and main analyses were different. For example, the magnitude of the effect size comparing PPAs to Open areas for fish density was smaller when the habitat-confounded studies were removed from the analysis. The positive effect of protection (partial:open) on non-target fish species changed from significant to non-significant when the habitat-confounded studies were excluded from the analysis. Other times, the two analyses did not differ. For example, the response for fish assemblage density in NTRs relative to PPAs was not significant, whether the ‘habitat-confounded’ studies were removed from the full dataset or not. These observations highlight the importance of examining the influence of habitat effects on the response of biota to protection in future assessments of MPA efficacy. Furthermore, the implications of ignoring confounding effects due to habitat differences between protected and control areas means that potentially unreliable and biased recommendations are made to policy-makers and conservation managers about the effects of protection.</p><p>The identification of ‘habitat-confounded’ studies has been a challenge in itself.

We could only identify ‘habitat-confounded’ studies with confidence when the authors explicitly reported significant differences in habitat among the sites studied inside and outside the MPA. Given that most studies did not examine the variation in habitat structure between protected and control areas, it is possible that some potentially habitat-confounded studies were not excluded from the sensitivity analysis, albeit our best efforts to eliminate this bias. We stress therefore, the importance for future studies to measure habitat covariates alongside biological data if assessment of change in a community is to be related to protection or to an intrinsic structural feature of the protected area.</p><p>A further challenge was controlling for the range and intensity of activities permitted within the PPAs as information on fishing intensity and effort characteristic of the fishery in the PPA was essentially negligible. In the absence of such detailed information, we used information on whether the permitted activities inside the PPA occurred on a commercial or recreational basis to define PPA protection regime categories. We based this categorization on the assumption that fishing pressure and efficiency are lower for recreational fishing than for commercial fishing practices. Although this assumption holds true for some recreational fisheries, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that recreational fishing can constitute a significant portion of the regional catch for some species [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 113" title="Coleman FC, Figueira WF, Ueland JS, Crowder LB: The impact of United States recreational fisheries on marine fish populations.

First was the lack of data on the historic levels of exploitation inside the MPA prior to its designation, which is one factor highly likely to influence the magnitude of protection effect. For example, Edgar et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 112" title="Edgar GJ, Barrett NS, Crane K, Bancroft K: Ecosystem monitoring of subtidal reefs in different management zones of the Jurien Bay Marine Park 1999–2007.

Conversely, McLean et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 115" title="McLean DL, Harvey ES, Fairclough DV, Newman SJ: Large decline in the abundance of a targeted tropical lethrinid in areas open and closed to fishing.

For example, studies that have measured large numbers of species may exhibit stronger positive responses due to the higher probability of including species that benefit from protection. The number of species pooled together to create average effect sizes for each ‘exploitation status’ category was found to be significantly related to the magnitude of response of target species biomass to protection in fully- vs. partially-protected areas. Although this covariate did not influence target species density or the effect size comparing partially- vs. open areas, we cannot rule out the potential methodological bias introduced by pooling individual species responses.</p><p>Small sample sizes and lack of power are clearly problematic in some instances, for example invertebrate species and biological measures such as species length.

The available evidence suggests that no-take reserves provide some benefit over less protected areas, nevertheless the significant ecological effects of partially protected areas relative to open access areas suggest that partially protected areas are a valuable spatial management tool particularly in areas where exclusion of all extractive activities is not a socio-economically and politically viable option. Change in the distribution of fishing effort could result in economically negligible net benefits [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 123" title="Jones PJS: Fishing industry and related perspectives on the issues raised by no-take marine protected area proposals.

Hence, while acknowledging that MPAs are not a panacea for conservation and fisheries management, under the right conditions (that may include additional reduction of fishing effort in fishing grounds surrounding MPAs, or a network of MPAs that allow a mix of protection levels, or involvement of multiple stakeholder groups during the designation process), MPAs offering partial protection are valuable tools for the preservation and enhancement of fish and invertebrate populations.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec53">Implications for research and further work</h4><p>Lack of data is a hindrance in the development of an evidence-base regarding the effectiveness of marine protected areas. Small sample sizes result in high uncertainty about the impacts on specific taxa, in particular, invertebrates, and species groups such as non-target fish species. Insufficient data are available regarding species richness and length (i.e. body size) of individual species and the effect of protection in soft sediment systems. It is also very difficult to distinguish habitat effects from reserve effects without integrated experimental monitoring programs that present data regarding the baseline condition. Hence, we urge future studies to measure habitat covariates alongside biological data. Given the clear evidence of the influence of exploitation intensity on MPA performance, we stress that measures of the fishing pressure outside the MPA, the historic levels of exploitation within the MPA prior to designation and the range of restricted and permitted activities within partially protected MPAs should be routinely reported as these factors allow for a robust within-context interpretation of the protection effect. Data regarding the degree of enforcement and compliance inside an MPA are required alongside biological metrics for monitoring to be effective. Whilst acknowledging the time constraints and increased financial costs associated with BACI empirical studies, we advocate that the controversy as to whether any differences are a consequence of protection or are merely coincidental can only be satisfactorily addressed by further monitoring incorporating assessment of change from baseline conditions.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec54">Appendix</h3><p>
