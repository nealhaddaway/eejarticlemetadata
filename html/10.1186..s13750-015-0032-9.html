        <title>What is the influence of a reduction of planktivorous and benthivorous fish on water quality in temperate eutrophic lakes? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="In recent decades, many attempts have been made to restore eutrophic lakes through biomanipulation. Reducing the populations of planktivorous and benthivorous fish (either directly or through stocking of piscivorous fish) may induce ecosystem changes that increase water transparency and decrease the risk of algal blooms and fish kills, at least in the short term. However, the generality of biomanipulation effects on water quality across lake types and geographical regions is not known. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic review of such effects in eutrophic lakes in temperate regions throughout the world. Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. To reduce the risk of bias, we then critically appraised the combined evidence found on each biomanipulation. Data were extracted on outcomes such as Secchi depth and chlorophyll a concentration before, during and/or after manipulation, and on effect modifiers such as lake properties and amounts of fish removed or stocked. Our searches identified more than 14,500 articles. After screening for relevance, 233 of them remained. After exclusions based on critical appraisal, our evidence base included useful data on 128 biomanipulations in 123 lakes. Of these interventions, 85% had been made in Europe and 15% in North America. Meta-analysis showed that removal of planktivores and benthivores (with or without piscivore stocking) leads to increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll a concentration during intervention and the first three years afterwards. Piscivore stocking alone has no significant effect. The response of chlorophyll a levels to biomanipulation is stronger in lakes where fish removal is intense, and in lakes which are small and/or have high pre-manipulation concentrations of total phosphorus. Our review improves on previous reviews of biomanipulation in that we identified a large number of case studies from many parts of the world and used a consistent, repeatable process to screen them for relevance and susceptibility to bias. Our results indicate that removal of planktivorous and benthivorous fish is a useful means of improving water quality in eutrophic lakes. Biomanipulation tends to be particularly successful in relatively small lakes with short retention times and high phosphorus levels. More thorough fish removal increases the efficacy of biomanipulation. Nonetheless successes and failures have occurred across a wide range of conditions."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="What is the influence of a reduction of planktivorous and benthivorous fish on water quality in temperate eutrophic lakes? A systematic review"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="In recent decades, many attempts have been made to restore eutrophic lakes through biomanipulation. Reducing the populations of planktivorous and benthivorous fish (either directly or through stocking of piscivorous fish) may induce ecosystem changes that increase water transparency and decrease the risk of algal blooms and fish kills, at least in the short term. However, the generality of biomanipulation effects on water quality across lake types and geographical regions is not known. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic review of such effects in eutrophic lakes in temperate regions throughout the world. Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. To reduce the risk of bias, we then critically appraised the combined evidence found on each biomanipulation. Data were extracted on outcomes such as Secchi depth and chlorophyll a concentration before, during and/or after manipulation, and on effect modifiers such as lake properties and amounts of fish removed or stocked. Our searches identified more than 14,500 articles. After screening for relevance, 233 of them remained. After exclusions based on critical appraisal, our evidence base included useful data on 128 biomanipulations in 123 lakes. Of these interventions, 85% had been made in Europe and 15% in North America. Meta-analysis showed that removal of planktivores and benthivores (with or without piscivore stocking) leads to increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll a concentration during intervention and the first three years afterwards. Piscivore stocking alone has no significant effect. The response of chlorophyll a levels to biomanipulation is stronger in lakes where fish removal is intense, and in lakes which are small and/or have high pre-manipulation concentrations of total phosphorus. Our review improves on previous reviews of biomanipulation in that we identified a large number of case studies from many parts of the world and used a consistent, repeatable process to screen them for relevance and susceptibility to bias. Our results indicate that removal of planktivorous and benthivorous fish is a useful means of improving water quality in eutrophic lakes. Biomanipulation tends to be particularly successful in relatively small lakes with short retention times and high phosphorus levels. More thorough fish removal increases the efficacy of biomanipulation. Nonetheless successes and failures have occurred across a wide range of conditions."/>

Reducing the populations of planktivorous and benthivorous fish (either directly or through stocking of piscivorous fish) may induce ecosystem changes that increase water transparency and decrease the risk of algal blooms and fish kills, at least in the short term. However, the generality of biomanipulation effects on water quality across lake types and geographical regions is not known. Therefore, we have undertaken a systematic review of such effects in eutrophic lakes in temperate regions throughout the world.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using inclusion criteria set out in an <i>a priori</i> protocol. To reduce the risk of bias, we then critically appraised the combined evidence found on each biomanipulation. Data were extracted on outcomes such as Secchi depth and chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration before, during and/or after manipulation, and on effect modifiers such as lake properties and amounts of fish removed or stocked.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Our searches identified more than 14,500 articles. After screening for relevance, 233 of them remained. After exclusions based on critical appraisal, our evidence base included useful data on 128 biomanipulations in 123 lakes. Of these interventions, 85% had been made in Europe and 15% in North America. Meta-analysis showed that removal of planktivores and benthivores (with or without piscivore stocking) leads to increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration during intervention and the first three years afterwards. Piscivore stocking alone has no significant effect. The response of chlorophyll <i>a</i> levels to biomanipulation is stronger in lakes where fish removal is intense, and in lakes which are small and/or have high pre-manipulation concentrations of total phosphorus.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>Our review improves on previous reviews of biomanipulation in that we identified a large number of case studies from many parts of the world and used a consistent, repeatable process to screen them for relevance and susceptibility to bias. Our results indicate that removal of planktivorous and benthivorous fish is a useful means of improving water quality in eutrophic lakes. Biomanipulation tends to be particularly successful in relatively small lakes with short retention times and high phosphorus levels. More thorough fish removal increases the efficacy of biomanipulation. Nonetheless successes and failures have occurred across a wide range of conditions.</p></div></div></section>

The reduced light penetration and increased sedimentation of dead planktonic algae puts submerged macrophytes at a disadvantage, in some cases even eliminating them, often with strong impacts on ecosystem interactions and dynamics [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Jeppesen E, Søndergaard M, Søndergaard M, Christoffersen K.

Certain species of phytoplankton – cyanobacteria in particular – can give rise to massive ‘algal blooms’ in the summer. The decomposition of dead plankton can lead to oxygen depletion and fish kills [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Brönmark C, Hansson L-A.

One important reason is that phosphorus stored in the sediments of eutrophied lakes can exchange with the water and thereby keep it nutrient-rich for decades [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Søndergaard M, Jensen JP, Jeppesen E.

There are indications that eutrophication has caused many lakes to shift from one state to another. In shallow unstratified lakes, one state is characterised by moderate abundance of phytoplankton, transparent water and vegetated bottoms, the other by high abundance of phytoplankton, turbid water and little or no submerged vegetation. In deep stratified lakes, one state is characterised by an oxygenated hypolimnion and low recycling of phosphorus, and the other by anoxia in the hypolimnion and rapid recycling of phosphorus. Once a lake has reached the latter state, it may tend to remain there even if nutrient concentrations in the water decrease.</p><p>The occurrence of ‘alternative states’ (stable turbid or clear-water states) of pelagic ecosystems can be a consequence of food web interactions [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Carpenter SR.

Certain food web configurations lead to high abundances of planktivores, or fishes that eat zooplankton. Planktivorous fish species can feed intensively on zooplankton and thereby release phytoplankton from grazing, leading to turbid water. The predation by planktivorous fish can therefore sustain eutrophic conditions in the lake, conditions that are beneficial to the fish themselves, and this feedback may prevent the lake from returning to less eutrophic conditions despite reduced nutrient inputs.</p><p>In some cases where eutrophied lakes have failed to recover after a reduction of nutrient supplies, attempts have been made to remedy the problems through intervention in the lakes themselves.

In Eurasia, cyprinids such as roach (<i>Rutilus rutilus</i>) and bream (<i>Abramis brama</i>) are among the most common planktivores in nutrient-rich lakes. In North America, important planktivores of eutrophic lakes include sunfish (<i>Lepomis</i> spp.) and gizzard shad (<i>Dorosoma cepedianum</i>) as well as various cyprinid species.</p><p>Reducing the stocks of planktivorous fishes enhances survival of the zooplankton that such fish feed on, and this in turn can reduce the abundance of planktonic algae that serve as food for the zooplankton [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Meijer M-L, de Boois I, Scheffer M, Portielje R, Hosper H.

Another reason why removal of planktivorous fish may improve water quality is that the adults of some of these species (e.g. bream and gizzard shad) are also benthivorous. They search for food in the sediments, dispersing nutrient-rich silt and thereby adding to the turbidity and high phosphorus content of the water in eutrophic lakes [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Bergman E, Hansson L-A, Persson A, Strand J, Romare P, Enell M, et al.

Their feeding behaviour may also contribute to the lack of submerged vegetation in such lakes.</p><p>The dominance of planktivorous/benthivorous species in eutrophic lakes has been related to the possibility that such species induce an interspecific competitive bottleneck in the recruitment of juvenile predators to predatory (piscivorous) stages, thereby limiting the predation pressure by piscivores [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Persson L.

One factor that may induce such a bottleneck is the presence of resources (e.g. cyanobacteria) that are exclusively available to planktivorous/benthivorous species. Another is that many planktivorous/benthivorous species are less affected in their feeding by the low water clarity in eutrophic lakes than visually feeding piscivorous species [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Persson L.

If alternative states of water clarity do occur, the lake may remain in the new state induced by biomanipulation if it is not destabilised by some other event. If the lake has only a turbid stable state, the rate at which it returns to its previous condition after biomanipulation will among other things depend on the time scale at which the slowest component of its ecosystem operates.

First they were assessed by title by a single reviewer (CB). In cases of uncertainty, the reviewer chose inclusion rather than exclusion. As a check of consistency, a subset of 100 articles was assessed by all members of the review team. Since this check showed that the main reviewer was considerably more inclusive than the average team member, it seemed safe to proceed with the screening without modification or further specification of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.</p><p>Next, each article found to be potentially relevant on the basis of title was judged for inclusion on the basis of abstract, again by a single reviewer (CB) who in cases of uncertainty tended towards inclusion. A second reviewer (LP) assessed a subset consisting of 199 (10%) of the abstracts, and the agreement between the two reviewers’ assessments was checked with a kappa test. Since the outcome, κ = 0.71, indicated a ‘substantial’ agreement [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 40" title="Landis JR, Koch GG.

This task was shared by all members of the review team. The articles were randomly distributed within the team, but some redistribution was then made to avoid having reviewers assess studies authored by themselves or articles written in an unfamiliar language. Articles found using search engines, specialist websites, review bibliographies or stakeholder contacts were also entered at this stage in the screening process. Doubtful cases – articles that the reviewer could not include or exclude with certainty even after having read the full text – were discussed and decided on by the entire team.</p><p>A list of all articles rejected on the basis of full-text assessment is provided in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM2">2</a>: Table B together with the reasons for exclusion.

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec21">Data extraction strategy</h3><p>Annual means and variation of summer-season water-quality data have been extracted from tables and graphs in articles and reports, using image analysis software (WebPlotDigitizer) when necessary. In some cases, study authors or database managers were asked to supply data in digital format. This was done where useful data had been published in graphs from which they were difficult to extract accurately enough, or when it was known or assumed that considerable amounts of relevant but unpublished data could be available in addition to the published results.</p><p>In cases where raw data were received, summary statistics have been calculated by us. Where individual water-quality data have been available, multi-year means and variation have been calculated based on these data rather than on annual averages.</p><p>The summer season has been defined differently by different authors, but 1 May – 30 September is the most common choice. This was also the period that we used ourselves when selecting relevant raw data (although our search for data was global, all biomanipulations found suitable for quantitative analysis had been performed in the northern hemisphere).</p><p>Data on potential effect modifiers and other metadata were extracted from the included articles whenever available, but data on annual means of the atmospheric temperature were downloaded from the WorldClim database [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Hijmans RJ, Cameron SE, Parra JL, Jones PG, Jarvis A.

Data to be used in meta-analysis were then transferred to an Access database.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec22">Definitions of pre-, during- and post-manipulation periods</h4><p>Most studies of biomanipulations have a Before/After (‘BA’) design – they compare data that have been collected prior to and following the intervention (or at least during different stages of the intervention). Since a biomanipulation may extend over several months or even years, BA studies often present data sampled not only before and after but also during the intervention. Due to the complexity of many biomanipulation projects, however, it is not always obvious when the main intervention started or ended. For instance, mass removals of fish may have been preceded or followed by less significant fish removals, and stocking may have taken place not only after periods of mass removal but also before or during them.</p><p>For intervention involving fish removal, we defined the <i>main biomanipulation period</i> as the years during which significant amounts of fish (at least 7–8 kg per hectare) were removed. Piscivore stocking performed within this period was normally seen as part of the main biomanipulation, but not if the fish removal resulted in complete eradication of the fish stocks. For interventions based on stocking only, the main biomanipulation period was defined as the years during which adult piscivores or significant numbers of young piscivores (at least 50–100 individuals per hectare) were stocked. A single year with insignificant or no fish removal or stocking was included in the main biomanipulation period if it was both preceded and followed by years with significant manipulation.</p><p>Building on these definitions, we applied the following rules to decide whether water-quality data sampled during a certain summer season represented Before, During or After conditions in the manipulated lake. Data that could not be included in any of these categories were not used.</p><p>The <i>Before</i> period was defined to stretch back as long as water-quality data were available and pre-manipulation summer conditions (concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll <i>a</i>, Secchi depth etc.) were reasonably stable. If confounding interventions or disturbances (e.g. aeration, dredging, in-lake chemical treatment, significant increases or decreases of phosphorus inputs, or fish-kills due to oxygen deficiency) took place during the pre-manipulation period, the Before period was said to start after the last onset or end of such events. The Before period was defined to end with (and include) the last pre-manipulation summer. Periods without water-quality data were included in the Before period if they lasted no more than 5 years and were preceded by a year with water-quality data.</p><p>The <i>During</i> period was defined to begin with the first during- or post-manipulation summer and conclude with the last year with significant biomanipulation. This means that no summer season was categorised as ‘During’ if the manipulation was confined to a single autumn.</p><p>The <i>After</i> period was defined to begin with the first post-manipulation year and last as long as water-quality data were available and no additional interventions or confounding events began. Periods without water-quality data were included in the After period if they lasted no more than 5 years and were followed by a year with water-quality data.</p><p>Two biomanipulations of a single lake were regarded as distinct interventions (to be analysed individually) if they were separated by at least 8–10 years without significant manipulation. The last 3 years before the second biomanipulation were then defined as the Before period of that intervention.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23">Data synthesis and presentation</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec24">Meta-analysability and selection of a high-quality dataset</h4><p>Although we have access to water-quality data for each of the biomanipulation projects included in this review, a considerable part of these projects do not appear in any of the meta-analyses described below. One reason is that for some biomanipulations, the available data do not include any of the water-quality parameters covered by the meta-analyses (Secchi depth, chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration and cyanobacteria abundance). Another reason is that some of the data available to us are not meta-analysable due to absence of useful information on variation (such as standard deviations, standard errors or confidence intervals) or on the number of observations. Published data on water quality in manipulated lakes sometimes consist of single measurements per year or of summer averages without any information on within-year variation. In other cases, published summer means or medians are accompanied by fractiles or ranges, but there is no reliable way of converting such data to measures of variation that can be used in meta-analyses.</p><p>Where water-quality data were available for more than one year within a Before-, During- or After-manipulation period, calculation of interannual variation enabled us to include them in some meta-analyses even if there was no useful information on within-year variation. However, due to the large seasonal fluctuations of primary production and phytoplankton abundance that characterise most eutrophic lakes, within-year variation of water quality may be larger than the interannual variation, even if the analysis is restricted to data sampled during summer. If this is the case, we may introduce bias by using effect sizes with interannual variation only, since such data will then tend to have lower variance and hence be given higher weight in meta-analyses than if their within-year variation had been known and included too.</p><p>Another important quality aspect is the presence or absence of confounding interventions or disturbances. Biomanipulation has frequently been performed in combination with other efforts to improve water quality, such as aeration or artificial mixing of deep waters, dredging (sediment removal), sewage diversion or other reductions of external nutrient inputs, or in-lake phosphorus removal with aluminium or iron salts. In many eutrophic or hypertrophic lakes, moreover, fish-kills caused by oxygen deficiency may have water-quality effects resembling those of deliberate manipulations of the fish fauna.</p><p>For these reasons, much of our analysis uses a high-quality ‘selected dataset’ where effect sizes based on single data per year and/or confounded data have been excluded. An alternative way of identifying a high-quality dataset would have been to include effect sizes only for biomanipulations where data were categorised as having low susceptibility to bias. The classification of susceptibility to bias is somewhat coarse, however, being based on the combined evidence on a biomanipulation project rather than on individual effect sizes. Even for the same biomanipulation, some effect sizes may be based on confounded data or single data per year, while others are not.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec25">Meta-analyses</h4><p>The impacts of biomanipulation on water quality were mainly analysed using meta-analytical approaches. The meta-analyses were carried out using the metafor package [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Viechtbauer W. Conducting meta-analyses in R with the metafor package.

R: A language and environment for statistical computing.

Since all data for these variables could be converted to the same units (m and μg/l, respectively), the comparisons were based on mean differences. The effect sizes were calculated as the difference between the mean response during or after the main biomanipulation period and the mean response before the manipulation. Positive effect sizes thus indicate that the response parameter was higher during or after intervention than before intervention. When analysing effect sizes based on the selected dataset, we also explored the consequences of exchanging mean differences for mean log ratios.</p><p>Moreover, a few meta-analyses were made of data on cyanobacteria abundance. Since these data were given in several incommensurable units, mean log ratios were used as effect sizes for the cyanobacteria meta-analyses.</p><p>Random effects models were developed for each response variable, comparing data acquired Before/During or Before/After manipulation. For the Before/After comparisons, models were developed for each of the first 7 years after manipulation, as well as the average of years 1–3 after manipulation. Random effects models were run using restricted maximum likelihood to estimate heterogeneity, and data are presented in forest plots showing mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. Random effect models were also developed for separate subgroups of comparisons, covering various aspects of data quality and different types of biomanipulation.</p><p>To investigate to what extent lake properties and biomanipulation methods influence the effects of biomanipulation on Secchi depth and chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations, we performed meta-regressions on Before/During and Before/After comparisons (the latter covering years 1–3 after manipulation). The most relevant effect modifiers – lake area, mean depth, retention time, pre-manipulation total phosphorus (TP) concentration, mean annual atmospheric temperature, duration of fish removals, amount of fish removed (expressed as kg/ha or kg/ha/yr) and depletion of fish stocks – were used as co-variates.</p><p>Data were not plentiful enough to allow a complete analysis using all explanatory variables simultaneously. However, since lake area, mean depth and pre-manipulation TP concentration were highly correlated (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM4">4</a>), we applied principal component analysis (PCA) to convert observations of these lake properties into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components, PC). We then used the first PC (PC1) as an explanatory variable in the meta-regressions.</p><p>PC1 explained 80% or more of the variation in the three selected lake properties, reflecting increasing lake area and decreasing pre-manipulation TP concentrations, whereas mean depth was mainly reflected in PC2 that only explained a minor part of the variation (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM5">5</a>).</p><p>Meta-regression models were made using the combined ‘lake-property’ variable (PC1), a measure of intervention strength (fish removals expressed as kg/ha/yr), and the interaction between these two as explanatory variables. Selection between the models (including the intercept-only model) was based upon minimum Akaike’s information criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc).</p><p>Since we were not able to test all effect modifiers listed above at the same time, we also performed meta-regressions with each of them separately.</p><p>All meta-regressions were based on the selected dataset, with stocking-only biomanipulations excluded (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Sec26">Results</a>). Due to skewness of the data, lake areas, mean depths, retention times, pre-manipulation TP concentrations and amounts of fish removed were log-transformed before analysis.</p><p>Finally, Secchi depth and chlorophyll <i>a</i> data (both from the selected set and from the entire set of meta-analysable data) were tested for possible publication bias using funnel plots.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec26"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec26-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec26">Results</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec26-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Review descriptive statistics</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec28">Literature searches and screening</h4><p>The main searches for literature were conducted between 10 December 2012 and 4 March 2013, and an update was made on 26 October 2013.</p><p>Searches with the main English search terms in 15 publication databases returned a total of 28,329 articles (or 12,908 after removal of duplicates) – see Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig1">1</a>.

<p>After title screening of the 14,552 unique publications found by the main and complementary searches, 1,946 of them remained included. Screening based on abstract left 419 articles that still were considered as potentially relevant. Most of the excluded articles contained no relevant information on how water quality had responded to biomanipulation, or did not touch on reductions of planktivorous or benthivorous fish at all (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM6">6</a>).</p><p>Searches with Danish, Dutch and Swedish search terms in national bibliographic databases yielded 4, 3 and 7 potentially relevant publications in these languages, respectively. Searches using search engines returned 33 potentially relevant articles (17 found with English search terms, 10 with Danish and 6 with Swedish ones) in addition to those that already had been identified. Similarly, searches on specialist websites located another 9 potentially useful publications (2 found using English search terms and 7 using Danish ones). An additional 38 articles were found in bibliographies of literature reviews, while 38 more were added by members of the review team or included as a result of stakeholder contacts or Google searches for the names of known biomanipulated lakes. A large part of the publications referred to in this paragraph can be characterised as grey literature.</p><p>In all, the searches resulted in 551 articles to be screened based on full text. After screening, 231 of them were still included. At this stage, the most common reason for exclusion was that studies contained no relevant primary data (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM6">6</a> and Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM2">2</a>: Table B).

A single lake could be referred to in up to twenty different articles, while a single publication could describe a large number of different manipulation projects. Quality assessment of the available evidence was therefore performed per lake rather than per article.</p><p>This assessment led to the exclusion of 29 lakes from the review, since the evidence found on them was categorised as highly susceptible to bias. The most common reason for exclusion was that data on pre-manipulation water quality were insufficient or entirely absent (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM3">3</a>).</p><p>In 5 of the 123 manipulated lakes that remained included in the review, interventions had been performed twice at sufficiently long intervals (8–10 years or more) that they could be regarded as independent of each other.

<p>The included lakes are typically shallow, small, and hypertrophic rather than merely eutrophic (see Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab2">2</a>).

<p>Of the 128 individual lake biomanipulations in the review, 102 included fish removal. In 81 of these cases, stocks of planktivorous and/or benthivorous fish were decimated solely by fishing. Eleven other manipulations involved rotenone or other piscicides, while ten included partial or complete emptying of the lake or reservoir, often but not always in combination with fishing (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM7">7</a>: Table C). Several of the latter interventions resulted in complete eradication of all fish species. In 35 cases where planktivorous and benthivorous fish were decimated, this intervention was combined with stocking of piscivores such as northern pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>), pikeperch (<i>Sander lucioperca</i>) or perch (<i>Perca fluviatilis</i>). The biomanipulations reviewed by us also include 26 cases solely based on piscivore stocking.</p><p>Details on the included biomanipulations are presented in three tables in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM7">7</a>. Table A in this file provides basic data on the manipulated lakes: location, lake type, lake area, mean depth, occurrence of stratification in summer, retention time, average pre-manipulation concentration of total phosphorus in summer, and mean annual atmospheric temperature. Table B presents study design, assessments of study quality, basic data on the main biomanipulation (type, timing and duration), and a selection of water-quality data (summer averages of Secchi depth and chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration before and during the main biomanipulation and in the first three post-manipulation years).

<p>Of the 128 biomanipulations included in the review, 125 are covered by studies that – in a wide sense – have a ‘BA’ (Before/After) design. In 86 of these cases, we have access to water-quality data sampled not only before and after but also during the main biomanipulation, and we therefore refer to them as having a ‘BDA’ (Before/During/After) design (see the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Sec5">Methods</a> section). In 27 other cases, we have data collected before and during the biomanipulation, but not afterwards. We refer to such cases as having a ‘BD’ (Before/During) design. The remaining 12 cases may be called ‘true BA’, since in these cases we have access to data collected before and after but not during the manipulation.</p><p>Three of the biomanipulations in the review – Bleiswijkse Zoom, Prairie Potholes 2 (adults) and Prairie Potholes 2 (fry) – are covered by studies that present no pre-manipulation data. Instead, these studies are based on comparisons between the manipulated lakes and similar lakes where no such intervention has taken place. This means that they have a ‘CI’ (Comparator/Intervention) design. In our quantitative synthesis, CI comparisons made during biomanipulation are included among Before/During comparisons, whereas CI comparisons made after biomanipulation are included among Before/After comparisons.</p><p>The outcomes that we have extracted from articles and databases are dominated by observations of Secchi depth, chlorophyll <i>a</i> and total phosphorus. We also extracted data on abundances of cyanobacteria, total phytoplankton, <i>Daphnia</i>, Cladocera and total zooplankton, although such information was found for relatively few of the biomanipulations (see Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab3">3</a>). Data on oxygen levels, concentrations of suspended solids and cover of macrophytes were found to be too scarce and/or heterogeneous to be useful. We have also chosen not to use data on total nitrogen concentrations – such data are frequently available in the literature, but they have limited relevance to lake eutrophication.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3 <b>No. of biomanipulations with available effect sizes</b>

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec34">An overview of all available Secchi depth and chlorophyll <i>a</i> data</h4><p>The biomanipulations reviewed here include interventions of highly varying strength, ranging from very modest planktivore/benthivore removal (only 13–30 kg/ha/yr in some cases) or stocking of limited numbers of piscivores to complete eradication of the entire fish fauna. Moreover, they have been performed in a set of lakes that covers wide ranges of size, depth, trophic status and climatic conditions.</p><p>Yet, even a cursory inspection of the outcomes indicates that a clear majority of the interventions have had positive effects on water quality (see Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig7">7</a> and Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM7">7</a>: Table B). Secchi depths have in most cases increased, whereas concentrations of chlorophyll <i>a</i> have in most cases decreased. These effects usually appear both during biomanipulation and in the early post-manipulation phase. Nonetheless, we found a great deal of variability among case studies, and there are cases of lakes that did not improve.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-7"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig7" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 7</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9/figures/7" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-015-0032-9/MediaObjects/13750_2015_32_Fig7_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-7-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-015-0032-9/MediaObjects/13750_2015_32_Fig7_HTML.gif" alt="figure7" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-7-desc"><p><b>Effect sizes based on mean Secchi depth and chlorophyll</b> <b><i>a</i></b> <b>concentration.</b> All biomanipulations with available data are represented in the diagram. ‘Before’ and ‘During’ periods have been defined as in Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig5">5</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig6">6</a>.

The first three years after biomanipulation, Secchi depths are 0.46 m greater and chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations 30 μg/l lower than before manipulation, again based on averages of all meta-analysable data. All these summary effect sizes are statistically significant (see the topmost row in Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig8">8</a> and pp. 1–4 in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM10">10</a>).</p><p>Calculation of interannual variation has enabled us to include some water-quality data in meta-analyses even in cases when there was no useful information on within-year variation (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Sec5">Methods</a>). However, there are indications that the within-year variation of water quality differs from the interannual variation. In 13 lakes where we have multiple data per summer season for at least 5 years within a pre-, during- or post-manipulation period, the within-year Secchi depth variation during these periods was on average 56% larger than the interannual variation. For chlorophyll <i>a</i> data, the corresponding difference was 68%. There are also some differences between summary effect sizes based on single vs. multiple data per year (i.e. data with interannual variation only and data with within-year variation over one or several years, respectively), as shown on rows 2 and 3 in Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig8">8</a> (and pp. 5–8 in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM10">10</a>). The difference is statistically significant for Before/During comparisons of chlorophyll <i>a</i>, but while the summary effect size is smaller for single- than for multiple-per-year chlorophyll <i>a</i> data, the reverse applies to Secchi depth data.</p><p>Moreover, we have classified outcomes of about a quarter of the included biomanipulations as confounded since additional interventions or disturbances took place during, just before or just after the main biomanipulation (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM7">7</a>: Table B). Confounded effect sizes tend to be smaller than non-confounded ones (see Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig8">8</a>, rows 4 and 5, and Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM10">10</a>, pp. 9–12).</p><p>In order to reduce the risk of bias, we have based most of the further quantitative analysis on the ‘selected dataset’ from which single data per year and confounded data have been excluded (see the <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Sec5">Methods</a> section).

For Secchi depth, they are almost identical to summary effect sizes based on all meta-analysable data, whereas for chlorophyll <i>a</i> they are somewhat larger, but not significantly so.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-4"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab4" data-test="table-caption">Table 4 <b>Summary effect sizes based on the selected dataset (mean differences to before manipulation)</b>

<p>Alternatively, we could have defined a high-quality dataset by including effect sizes only for those biomanipulations where data were categorised as having low susceptibility to bias (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Sec5">Methods</a>).

<p>Another factor that most likely contributes to the variation of summary effect sizes in Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig9">9</a> is that the data are based on different sets of manipulations in different years.

<p>It is difficult to draw any general conclusions from these results, however, since a selection effect is involved. In this review, we followed the water quality of manipulated lakes only as long as no new mass removals of fish or other large-scale interventions were carried out. In many cases, though, lake managers repeated the biomanipulation after a few years since the water quality had then deteriorated. After the renewed intervention, such lakes no longer appear in our data. This means that lakes where manipulation effects have been more persistent than average are likely to be overrepresented in the set of biomanipulations for which we have data over many years.</p><p>Moreover, in 6 of the 13 cases represented in Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig11">11</a> (panels at right), the main biomanipulation was followed up with other interventions (e.g. stocking or aeration) over several years, and this may have contributed to the persistence of the water-quality effects.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec38">Effects on cyanobacteria abundance</h4><p>Biomanipulation can also reduce the abundance of cyanobacteria (see Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig12">12</a>).

<p>The selected models for chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration during and after biomanipulation were both strongly supported (with AICc values more than 15 units less than the next best models; cf. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Burnham KP, Anderson DR. Model selection and multimodel inference: a practical information-theoretic approach.

The mean decrease of the chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration was greater during biomanipulation in lakes where fish removal was more intense, and it was greater both during and after biomanipulation in lakes that were small and/or had high pre-manipulation TP concentrations (i.e. small values of PC1; Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab6">6</a>). These relations also tended to reinforce each other – higher intensity of fish removal had a stronger effect on the chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration in lakes that were small and/or had high pre-manipulation TP concentrations (as shown by the sign of the interaction term between between PC1 and fish removal; Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab6">6</a>), both during and after biomanipulation. Lake characteristics, in terms of area and pre-manipulation TP, clearly influence the effect of biomanipulation on chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration both during and after manipulation, as the model with fish removal alone had a Δ AICc &gt; 20 (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab6">6</a>).</p><p>High intensity of fish removal also corresponded to greater increases in water transparency (measured as Secchi depth) during biomanipulation (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab6">6</a>). In contrast to chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations, Secchi depth changes during biomanipulation were not related to lake properties (as the best model included only the intensity of fish removal). Several models of water transparency after biomanipulation received similar level of support (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab6">6</a>). The most supported model included only lake properties (PC1), but the support for the null (intercept only) model was almost as high (Δ AICc = 1.15). The model with only fish removal also had a Δ AICc &lt; 2, showing that Secchi depth after biomanipulation may be explained either by lake properties or intervention strength.</p><p>For the purposes of exploration and illustration, we also performed meta-regressions with single effect modifiers (see Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig14">14</a> and Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM12">12</a>). These showed the improvement of water-quality caused by biomanipulation to decrease with lake area and to increase with pre-manipulation TP concentration (although not significantly so for Secchi depth after manipulation). Moreover, the effect of biomanipulation on chlorophyll <i>a</i> decreased significantly with increasing retention time. We also found that biomanipulation effects on water quality increased with fish removals as expressed per hectare and year (significantly so for Secchi depth and chlorophyll <i>a</i> during but not after manipulation; see Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig14">14</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig15">15</a>) and with the depletion of fish stocks (but significantly so only for Secchi depth after manipulation; see Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig14">14</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig16">16</a>).</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-14"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig14" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Figure 14</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9/figures/14" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-015-0032-9/MediaObjects/13750_2015_32_Fig14_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-14-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-015-0032-9/MediaObjects/13750_2015_32_Fig14_HTML.gif" alt="figure14" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-14-desc"><p><b>Relations between biomanipulation effects, lake properties and measures of intervention strength.</b> Colours indicate whether changes of lake properties or intervention strength tend to strengthen or weaken the ability of biomanipulation to improve water quality (i.e. its ability to increase the Secchi depth or decrease the chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration).

<p>Using effect sizes based on mean log ratios instead of mean differences produces similar results, although relations between Secchi depth changes and effect modifiers tend to become more significant, whereas the reverse applies to chlorophyll <i>a</i> changes.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec41">Tests for possible publication bias</h4><p>Earlier reviews have found certain evidence of publication bias in the literature about biomanipulation effects – seemingly, negative results have not been reported to the same extent as positive experiences [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Gulati RD, Pires LMD, Van Donk E.

In this review, we tested our selection of studies for publication bias using funnel plots (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#MOESM13">13</a>). These plots do indicate that studies that have high precision (i.e. low standard error, usually due to a large number of observations) generally report effect sizes closer to zero than studies with lower precision. This asymmetry, which suggests the possibility of publication bias, is clearly visible when all studies in the review are considered, especially among Secchi depth data, but it also appears in the selected dataset.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec42"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec42-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec42">Discussion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec42-content"><p>Our review and meta-analysis show that biomanipulation of lakes increases Secchi depth and decreases chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig8">8</a>, Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab4">4</a>). Nonetheless, there is considerable variability among lakes, which is discussed further below. Within this variability some significant patterns are evident: (1) The effects of biomanipulation are significant during and 1–3 years after treatment (Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig9">9</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig10">10</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig11">11</a>). (2) Removal of planktivores and benthivores, with or without stocking of piscivores, is capable of improving water clarity, but piscivore stocking alone has no significant effect of that kind (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig13">13</a>). (3) Lakes that do not respond to biomanipulation tend to have longer water residence times and lower percentage depletion of stocks of planktivorous and benthivorous fish (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab5">5</a>). There is also a tendency for non-responding lakes to be larger in surface area, although there is a wide range in lake area for responding and non-responding lakes. (4) Effects of biomanipulation on chlorophyll <i>a</i> are significantly stronger in cases where fish removal is more intense and where pre-manipulation TP is higher and/or the lake area smaller.</p><p>Cyanobacteria are of special interest in lake management because of their potential toxicity and their capacity to form noxious scums on the lake surface. The case studies that reported responses of cyanobacteria were fewer than those that reported Secchi depth or chlorophyll <i>a</i>. Nonetheless, we found that biomanipulation significantly decreased cyanobacteria concentrations for up to three years after treatment (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig12">12</a>).</p><p>Our review improves in several ways on previous reviews of biomanipulation. We obtained all of the literature that was available on a range of literature databases and systematically screened for useful studies.

<p>On the other hand, our findings on the importance of lake properties differ from conclusions of some previous reviews (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab7">7</a>). Several authors point out that biomanipulation is mainly successful in shallow and/or small lakes [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Drenner RW, Hambright KD.

Nonetheless, we found that biomanipulation effect size declines with increasing lake area. We found that lakes with higher pre-manipulation TP respond more strongly to biomanipulation. Thus our findings do not support the conclusion that biomanipulation will not work if TP is too high [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Mehner T, Benndorf J, Kasprzak P, Koschel R.

The number of lakes with long-lasting biomanipulation effects was small, however (see next section), and data that would allow an analysis of mechanisms related to alternative stable states (such as the development of macrophytes over time) were lacking in most of these cases. We therefore refrain from attempting any such analysis in this report.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec43">Reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>The variability among lakes in responses to biomanipulation has many dimensions, some of which can be illuminated using our dataset. It must be noted that no review of biomanipulation, including ours, has access to datasets in which important co-variates such as lake area, phosphorus loading, and magnitude of fish removal are statistically independent and sampled continuously from pre-manipulation until effect of the manipulation are no longer discernible. In the absence of such datasets, any evaluation of co-variate effects is provisional. Nonetheless, several statistically significant effects of co-variates should be discussed here.</p><p>Data quality appears to influence outcomes, especially the response of chlorophyll <i>a</i> (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig8">8</a>). Therefore we focused on a high-quality ‘selected’ dataset that excludes studies based on a single datum per year and studies that confound biomanipulation with other types of manipulations.</p><p>Effects of biomanipulation are detectable statistically up to 3 years after the manipulation in the meta-analysis (Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig9">9</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig10">10</a>). Biomanipulation studies performed over longer periods are rare, however, and the variation of summary effect sizes increases as the number of lakes included in the meta-analyses goes down with the number of years elapsed after intervention (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig9">9</a>). No statistically significant effect can therefore be found 4 years or more after biomanipulation, but the mean effect sizes show no obvious signs of diminishing even up to 7 years after intervention (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig9">9</a>). In certain lakes the effects of biomanipulation last considerably longer, up to 10 or more years (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig11">11</a>). Long-lasting effects were observed in deep stratified lakes (e.g. Mendota) as well as shallow well-mixed ones (e.g. Zwemlust). These results are in line with findings by Gulati and Van Donk [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 45" title="Gulati R, van Donk E.

It is easier to remove large fractions of the benthivore and planktivore stocks from smaller lakes, which may be one reason why these tend to show stronger responses to biomanipulation. Lakes with longer retention times (i.e. slowly-flushed lakes) are less affected by biomanipulation, maybe because fish removal effects are counteracted by a higher degree of internal phosphorus loading. Lakes with high pre-manipulation TP show stronger responses to biomanipulation, especially when it comes to chlorophyll <i>a</i>. Initial chlorophyll concentrations are often very high in highly eutrophied lakes, which could mean that a large chlorophyll reduction (in absolute terms) is easier to achieve there than in less eutrophic lakes with lower pre-manipulation chlorophyll levels. These speculations are interesting topics for future research but cannot be resolved here.</p><p>Intervention strength has variable but detectable effects on the response of lakes to biomanipulation (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Tab5">5</a>, Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig14">14</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig15">15</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig16">16</a>). The high variance of fish population estimates may be a factor in the statistical analyses. Uncertainty in the x-axis will decrease the slope of a regression, for example (e.g. Figures <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig15">15</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig16">16</a>). Nonetheless, there may be real effects of intervention strength as also noted in some earlier review papers [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Meijer M-L, de Boois I, Scheffer M, Portielje R, Hosper H.

Removals of benthivores and planktivores from Zwemlust in 1987 were exceptionally high, and the response to biomanipulation was also large (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-015-0032-9#Fig15">15</a>). As noted above, water quality improvements lasted for an exceptionally long time in Zwemlust.</p><p>Chlorophyll <i>a</i> and Secchi depth are widely-used measures of water quality. Secchi depth is largely determined by chlorophyll <i>a</i>, which is a proxy for phytoplankton abundance. The two variables are inversely related, but the correlation is never perfect. At a given chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration, the Secchi depth can be higher or lower depending on the concentration of coloured dissolved organic matter, the concentration of inorganic particles suspended in the water, or the particle size distribution of phytoplankton. Therefore we should not expect to obtain completely consistent results for chlorophyll <i>a</i> and Secchi depth responses to biomanipulation. It is worthwhile to examine both indicators.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec44">Review limitations</h3><p>We were unable to analyse every aspect of biomanipulation due to limitations of the available data. For example, we were not able to evaluate relations between biomanipulation and biodiversity. Nonetheless it is clear that certain species, such as rooted submerged plants and large-bodied cladocerans such as <i>Daphnia</i>, play a critical role in many successful biomanipulations. Moreover, the dataset did not allow us to explore the outcomes of piscivore stocking in relation to the species or sizes of stocked fish, although this could have refined our overall conclusion that piscivore stocking alone has no impact on water clarity.</p><p>Of the 128 biomanipulations included in this review, more than half (68) were carried out in Denmark or the Netherlands, where most lakes are small, shallow and nutrient-rich. The median area, depth and pre-manipulation TP of the included Danish and Dutch lakes were 23 ha, 1.5 m and 162 μg/l, respectively, whereas the corresponding medians for included lakes in other parts of the world were 78 ha, 2.7 m and 86 μg/l, respectively. This means that the selection of lakes in this review may not be entirely representative of e.g. Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian or North American lakes where biomanipulation has been carried out or could be considered as a future option.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec45"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec45-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec45">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec45-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec46">Implication for policy/management</h3><p>Available evidence suggests that biomanipulation is a useful means of improving water quality in eutrophic lakes. Removal of benthivorous and planktivorous fishes (with or without stocking of piscivores) is effective, but piscivore stocking alone is not. More thorough removal of benthivorous and planktivorous fishes increases the effectiveness of biomanipulation in reducing chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentrations. Biomanipulation tends to be particularly successful in relatively small lakes with short retention times and high pre-manipulation phosphorus levels.</p><p>Since long-lasting studies are rare, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding biomanipulation effects more than three years after intervention, but the duration of the effects clearly varies from case to case. In many cases re-treatment is necessary after a few years, but sometimes effects may last a decade or more.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec47">Implication for research</h3><p>Our review and meta-analysis uncovered several patterns worthy of further research. More research on the interactive effects of biomanipulation with other lake management tools would be useful and could reveal beneficial combinations of management interventions. The factors that lead to breakdown or persistence of biomanipulation effects in various types of lakes are not yet known. Better understanding could improve ecological theories related to stability and perhaps reveal new information useful for managers.</p><p>Our screening process excluded many biomanipulations that could have been analysed had authors provided appropriate data in their original publications. Researchers reporting on the outcomes of such interventions should always publish variances and sample sizes of water quality data, or provide raw data in an electronic appendix. The effects of biomanipulation cannot be assessed properly unless water quality data have been obtained prior to the intervention. Monitoring of water quality should also be continued for at least as long as effects remain evident. Quantitative measures of fish removal, stocking, or biomass changes are necessary and should always be reported.</p></div></div></section>
