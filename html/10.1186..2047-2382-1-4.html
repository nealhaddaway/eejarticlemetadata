        <title>The effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe - A systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Agriculture is the dominant land use throughout much of Europe. Changes to farming practices have led to concerns about negative impacts on biodiversity, and current agricultural policy has an emphasis towards conservation. The objective of this study was to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes as interventions for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe. Systematic mapping methodology was adapted from social sciences, and used to create a searchable database of relevant research. Searches were made of 10 electronic databases containing peer reviewed journals, PhD theses, conference proceedings and organisational reports. Web searches for relevant research were also made. The title and abstracts of results were examined for relevance. Studies were included when published in English, when an intervention was applied to increase biodiversity or species diversity on farmland, and where there was a measured effect on study organism(s). Correlative and manipulative studies from temperate Europe were included. The research was incorporated into a searchable database (systematic map) and key wording used to describe, categorise and code studies. The searches identified 83,590 records. Following removal of duplicates and the application of inclusion criteria, 743 references were coded for the final systematic map database. Most of the studies reported were from Western Europe, particularly from the UK. Invertebrates were the most commonly studied organism followed by plants and birds, and field margins were the most commonly studied biotope. The systematic map describes the scope of research on the topic. It can be used to inform future primary research, or research synthesis and evaluation methods such as systematic review. Areas for which there appear to be evidence gaps, and so may have potential for further primary research, are highlighted. They include the effectiveness of agri-environment options under different farming systems and in providing for amphibians and reptiles. Implications for the development of future systematic maps are discussed, including the question of how to incorporate study quality appraisal. The development of a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence systematic mapping methods group will address some of these issues."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Agriculture is the dominant land use throughout much of Europe. Changes to farming practices have led to concerns about negative impacts on biodiversity, and current agricultural policy has an emphasis towards conservation. The objective of this study was to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes as interventions for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe. Systematic mapping methodology was adapted from social sciences, and used to create a searchable database of relevant research. Searches were made of 10 electronic databases containing peer reviewed journals, PhD theses, conference proceedings and organisational reports. Web searches for relevant research were also made. The title and abstracts of results were examined for relevance. Studies were included when published in English, when an intervention was applied to increase biodiversity or species diversity on farmland, and where there was a measured effect on study organism(s). Correlative and manipulative studies from temperate Europe were included. The research was incorporated into a searchable database (systematic map) and key wording used to describe, categorise and code studies. The searches identified 83,590 records. Following removal of duplicates and the application of inclusion criteria, 743 references were coded for the final systematic map database. Most of the studies reported were from Western Europe, particularly from the UK. Invertebrates were the most commonly studied organism followed by plants and birds, and field margins were the most commonly studied biotope. The systematic map describes the scope of research on the topic. It can be used to inform future primary research, or research synthesis and evaluation methods such as systematic review. Areas for which there appear to be evidence gaps, and so may have potential for further primary research, are highlighted. They include the effectiveness of agri-environment options under different farming systems and in providing for amphibians and reptiles. Implications for the development of future systematic maps are discussed, including the question of how to incorporate study quality appraisal. The development of a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence systematic mapping methods group will address some of these issues."/>

Changes to farming practices have led to concerns about negative impacts on biodiversity, and current agricultural policy has an emphasis towards conservation. The objective of this study was to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes as interventions for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe.</p><p>Systematic mapping methodology was adapted from social sciences, and used to create a searchable database of relevant research.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches were made of 10 electronic databases containing peer reviewed journals, PhD theses, conference proceedings and organisational reports. Web searches for relevant research were also made. The title and abstracts of results were examined for relevance. Studies were included when published in English, when an intervention was applied to increase biodiversity or species diversity on farmland, and where there was a measured effect on study organism(s). Correlative and manipulative studies from temperate Europe were included. The research was incorporated into a searchable database (systematic map) and key wording used to describe, categorise and code studies.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>The searches identified 83,590 records. Following removal of duplicates and the application of inclusion criteria, 743 references were coded for the final systematic map database. Most of the studies reported were from Western Europe, particularly from the UK. Invertebrates were the most commonly studied organism followed by plants and birds, and field margins were the most commonly studied biotope.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The systematic map describes the scope of research on the topic. It can be used to inform future primary research, or research synthesis and evaluation methods such as systematic review. Areas for which there appear to be evidence gaps, and so may have potential for further primary research, are highlighted. They include the effectiveness of agri-environment options under different farming systems and in providing for amphibians and reptiles. Implications for the development of future systematic maps are discussed, including the question of how to incorporate study quality appraisal. The development of a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence systematic mapping methods group will address some of these issues.</p></div></div></section>

Systematic mapping like systematic review, is a robust, repeatable and transparent scientific method used to identify and categorise available literature on a particular topic. It uses established searching protocols and has rigorous criteria for inclusion or exclusion.</p><p>Unlike systematic review, however, systematic maps are not used to attempt to answer a question, and do not usually attempt full data extraction or critical appraisal of the relevant research. Instead, they identify and describe the nature, volume and characteristics of research in a chosen field

<p>In addition, web searches were performed using the search engines:
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com">http://www.alltheweb.com</a> and
<a href="http://scholar.google.com">http://scholar.google.com</a>. The first 50 hits (.doc .txt .xls and .pdf documents where this can be separated) from each data source were examined for appropriate data. No further links from the captured website were followed unless to a document/pdf file.</p><p>Database and repository searches were conducted in English language. A wildcard (*) was used to pick up multiple word endings (eg. Farm* would pick up farms, farming etc.). Birds and invertebrates were specifically searched for as potential farmland biodiversity indicators at the request of the original stakeholder group. The following terms were used in combination to search the online databases/web searches:</p><p>Farm* AND biodiversity</p><p>Organic AND biodiversity</p><p>Farm* AND (diversity or abundance) not fish</p><p>Agri-environment*</p><p>(Farmland or farming) AND bird*</p><p>(Farm* AND invertebrate*) not fish</p><p>Agri-environment* AND biodiversity</p><p>Where wildcards were not permitted extra searches were carried out to cover multiple word endings. ‘Integrated farm management’ was not searched for as a phrase, as any searches with farm* would have identified these references. Brackets were only used where databases allowed.</p><p>The results of the searches were imported into EndNote X2<sup>TM</sup> library files. A separate file was made for each search made. When searching was complete, all the database libraries were incorporated into one new library, and the number of references captured was recorded. Using the automatic function in the EndNote X2<sup>TM</sup> software, any duplicates were removed. The library was then searched for references relevant to the topic.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec10">Study inclusion criteria</h3><p>The inclusion criteria were applied by one reviewer to all studies at title and abstract level. For a random 20% of studies, and where it was not clear whether a study met the inclusion criteria, the study was screened by a second reviewer and any differences resolved through discussion. Reviewers discussed the procedures to ensure a consistent understanding of the criteria at both the screening and coding stages.</p><p>Relevant subject(s): Studies on some aspect of biodiversity or species diversity on farmland were included, irrespective of scale. All biotopes were included except for ponds, farm woodland and orchards. The scope of temperate Europe was defined as all European countries west of Russia, but not those south of France, Switzerland Austria, Hungary and Romania.</p><p>Types of intervention: Interventions that aimed to increase biodiversity on farmland, or some element of it, were considered: these included organic farming and integrated farm management, named agri-environment schemes, and specific options and biotopes that could form part of agri-environment, organic or integrated farming schemes.</p><p>Types of comparator: Conventional farming or a conventionally farmed plot.</p><p>Types of outcome: Effects on any organism or organisms excluding fungi, bacteria and agricultural pests. Any measure of biodiversity was considered. Differences or similarities in biodiversity on different farm types, and differences or similarities in biodiversity following management changes on farmland were considered.</p><p>Types of study: Any type of study that investigated biodiversity on farmland was considered, including correlative studies and manipulative studies but not pure ecology studies, statistical models, or review papers. Systematic maps, lacking strict critical appraisal, often include studies that would not be included in systematic reviews

Individual species were not recorded as this would have further expanded and complicated the database. Instead organisms were categorised as general groups: invertebrate, plant, bird, mammal, reptile or amphibian. Invertebrates were further categorised into four functional groups (identified as important for farmland systems by the stakeholder workshop participants): pollinators, natural enemies, soil organisms and invertebrate food for farmland birds. Some functional groups were further divided. For example, pollinators have been sub-divided into Lepidoptera (butterflies), Bombus spp. (bumblebees), Apoidae (solitary bees and unspecified bees) and Syrphidae (hoverflies). A subcategory ‘plants of conservation concern’ was also made where study authors had identified that the plants included in the research were of particular local or national conservation interest and/or that receive funding through agri-environment schemes.</p><p>The articles were coded under the following categories: author, full reference, date of publication, publication type, length of time of study, country/ies of study, spatial scale of experiment, farming system, farming prescription/intervention, biotope, organism, outcome investigated, and experimental design. Studies were defined as either correlative (where biodiversity outcomes had been compared between different biotopes as found) or manipulative (where artificial treatments were applied to test for effects on biodiversity). Studies could appear under more than one category where relevant. For example butterflies were categorised as invertebrate, pollinator, and as butterfly.</p><p>The coding was carefully moderated. All included articles were coded by one reviewer, and scrutinised by a second reviewer. Coding keywords were revised to resolve any inconsistencies between reviewers or in response to search findings. Any articles already coded, were re-coded using the revised keywords. A sample of coded articles was cross checked by a third independent reviewer to confirm understanding of coding.</p><p>The included references were exported from the EndNoteX2<sup>TM</sup> library to a Microsoft excel workbook where the coding was applied.

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18">Scale</h3><p>Most studies were performed across a variety of spatial scales. The most common combination was ‘within-field’ ‘multiple farm’. I.e. the study compared specific within-field interventions (such as field margin) with other interventions or crops, and evaluated results across a number of farms. Many of these studies could also be considered ‘landscape scale’ as studies were conducted on multiple farms in different regions of the UK. Very few articles (<i>n = 12</i>) reported studies made at the ‘whole farm scale’, i.e. investigating the impact of a named intervention (such as agri-environment scheme implementation) on biodiversity across the whole farm. A breakdown of the spatial scales of studies is given in Table

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Period of study</h3><p>Most abstracts (<i>n = 396</i>) did not mention the period of time over which the work took place. Of the remaining, most studies ( <i>50%</i>) were between 1 and 3 years duration, 19% were less than a year in duration, 10% took place over 4 years, 12% were carried out over 5 to 9 years, and 9% were carried out over 10 years or more.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Organisms and functional groups</h3><p>Invertebrates were the most commonly studied organisms (<i>n = 422</i>).

<p>Correlative and manipulative studies were found in similar numbers of articles for most groups, with the exception of birds, which were most commonly investigated in correlative studies (145 correlative; 75 manipulative; 6 combined correlative and manipulative). Articles reporting plants studies were slightly biased towards manipulative research (135 manipulative; 103 correlative; 5 combined correlative and manipulative) (Figure

This also provided an indication of the breakdown of the invertebrate composition, the most commonly studied taxanomic group. Pollinators (<i>n = 128</i>) and natural enemies ( <i>n = 127</i>) were the most studied functional groups. There were fewer study articles for soil organisms ( <i>n = 58</i>) and invertebrate food for farmland birds ( <i>n = 46</i>). There were similar numbers of correlative and manipulative studies for each functional group. Pollinator studies were mainly on Lepidoptera (butterflies) (52% of articles) and Bombus sp. (bumblebees) (34%). Studies on Apoidae (unspecified bees) (21%), Syrphidae (hoverflies) (16%), Apis sp. (honey bees) (5%) and Apoidae (solitary bees) (5%) made up the remainder. Natural enemy studies were mainly of Araneae (spiders) (71% of articles) and Carabidae (ground beetles) (48%) and to a lesser extent on Staphylinidae (rove beetles) (22%) and Syrphidae (hoverflies) (7%). Lumbricadae (earthworms) were the most commonly studied soil inverebrate ( <i>n = 35</i>) followed by Collembola (springtails) ( <i>n = 14</i>).

Invertebrates were the most studied group for all systems followed by plants and birds. Few studies examined mammals and plants of conservation concern and no studies were found for amphibians or reptiles. Invertebrates are considered important to organic and integrated farming, particularly natural enemies which are often used as a form of pest control. It was therefore unsurprising to find that natural enemies were the most studied invertebrate functional group. Soil organisms are also important in these systems for maintaining healthy soils and this is reflected in the number of articles captured. Natural enemies (n = 8) and soil organisms (n = 7) were also the most studied functional groups in comparisons of integrated and conventional farm management. In contrast, when organic and converntional farming systems were compared, plants (n = 36) and birds (n = 24) were more commonly reported than any invertebrate functional group. Pollinator studies were reported far more frequently in comparisons between organic and conventional farming systems (n = 13) than in integrated farming systems (n = 2). There were very few studies of farming system and invertebrate food for farmland birds.</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3

<p>Invertebrates, particularly soil organisms, were the focus of the tillage studies. One of the aims of conservation tillage is to reduce soil organism mortality, and so improve soil condition. Conservation tillage can also indirectly benefit other organisms by increasing prey availability (invertebrate food for birds for example).</p><p>Invertebrates, particularly pollinators, were also the most commonly reported study organisms in experiments investigating grassland (Table

Examples of this included, wild bird cover, conservation headlands, skylark plots, beetle banks and the Lapwing option. These type of options tend to be simple to implement on small scales, and are often targeted towards particular organisms so may be more conducive to manipulative studies. However, some named agri-environmental scheme options were more studied than others and, where named, often tended to be UK schemes. For example, conservation headlands (<i>n = 24 articles</i>), wild bird cover ( <i>n = 23</i>) and beetle banks ( <i>n = 16</i>) are all UK current or historic agri-environment schemes.</p><p>Many studies on hedgerows were correlative as were all those on green lanes.

<p>The subject organism often reflects the intent of the intervention. For example, wild bird cover tries to provide winter seed for farmland birds and most studies (17 of 24) were on birds but some investigated affects on other organisms either in addition or instead. Some options designed for birds (<i>e.g.</i> overwinter stubbles and skylark plots) often examine plants and invertebrates as these provide food sources for birds. Field margins on the other hand provide a habitat for a wide range of organisms but there has been a disproportionate amount of research on invertebrates.</p><p>Plants of conservation concern are often found within arable crops and grass fields. Five articles were found for plants of conservation concern in arable crops, and 2 for grass field.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26">Studies of the effect of farming system on the biodiversity of biotope</h3><p>As before, fallow studies were included within set-aside, riparian buffer strips in field margins and Ecological Compensation Area meadows in meadow management.

This is likely to reflect changes in policy on the farmed environment in temperate Europe, but could also be affected by known bias in the searches.</p><p>• Most studies were from Western Europe, in particular the UK where there has been a long history of such research. This will also reflect bias in the search strategy.</p><p>• The literature found was predominantly published in peer reviewed journals.</p><p>• Invertebrates were the most frequently studied type of organism, possibly because invertebrates are easily observed, provide food resource for other organisms, and may form important functional groups in agriculture (<i>e.g.</i>, natural enemies and pollinators). Some believe they are good indicators of overall biodiversity health, for example butterflies

Both are also believed to be good indicators of overall farmland biodiversity health

Furthermore, farmland birds are valued by the public and policy makers.</p><p>• There were more studies of pollinators and natural enemies than for soil organisms and invertebrate food for farmland birds.</p><p>• Research into the use of field margins as a mitigation measure for biodiversity far outweighed the available research for other biotopes and agri-environment options.</p><p>• In terms of how farming systems impact on biodiversity, organic farming has been studied more often than integrated farming.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec29">Gaps in the research</h3><p>• Little research on amphibians and reptiles was found, particularly in studies of agri-environmental schemes. This will partially reflect biases in the search, however, there have been general concerns that these groups have been overlooked in agricultural research

Specific literature searches for these organisms would confirm this.</p><p>• Some agri-environment scheme options appeared to be more studied than others. For example, conservation headlands, wild bird cover and beetle banks compared with others such as undersown cereals and cereal based whole crop silage. Searching terminology may have biased the findings for some options – ‘<i>bird</i>’ for example was included as a search term, so may have increased the number of references found for ‘wild <i>bird</i> cover’. Variations in local terminology may have also introduced bias. Where more focused information is required, searches for named agri-environment options tailored to the region and time period of interest are recommended.</p><p>• Little research comparing the impact of farming system, biotope or agri-environment options on biodiversity was found for Eastern European countries. It may be that Eastern European countries are less likely to publish in English, although this was not tested for.</p><p>• There was little research available relating to the impact of integrated farming on biodiversity.</p><p>• Further evidence is needed to test the efficacy of agri-environment schemes under different types of farming system. The majority of the research found focused on field margins and organic farming.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30">Recommendations for further development of the systematic map</h3><p>The systematic map is easily updatable. Any updating would provide the opportunity to improve the database.</p><p>Recommendations for updating include:</p><p>• Examination of the full text of included papers, where possible, in order to confirm coding and categorisation.</p><p>• Extension of the database to include additional coding for experimental design and data analysis within papers. This would help facilitate critical appraisal of the included research and also enable more efficient identification of topics suitable for future systematic reviews.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31">Potential systematic review topics</h3><p>The systematic map highlights subtopics that appear to be populated with enough primary research to inform specific systematic reviews. Areas where studies were manipulative rather than correlative may be likely to yield the most robust data for meta-analysis, although critical evaluation of the primary research papers would confirm this.</p><p>Invertebrates were the most commonly studied type of organism, with over 50% of studies manipulative. Pollinators (particularly Lepidoptera and Bombus spp.) and natural enemies (particularly arachnids and carabids) were the most frequently studied invertebrates, and abundance was the measure of outcome most frequently mentioned. Questions investigating which interventions affect the abundance of these invertebrates would be suitable for systematic review. Plants were also highly studied and tended to include data from manipulative experiments, although in some cases plants were used as a comparator for invertebrate abundance studies. There were large numbers of bird studies, but many were correlative and this would need to be taken into account in further analysis.</p><p>Field margins were the most commonly studied biotope, with 50% of the studies manipulative, and the majority of field margin experiments also investigating invertebrates.</p><p>Specific systematic review questions that are likely to yield data suitable for meta-analysis may include:</p><p>‘What is the comparative effectiveness of field margin management interventions (X, Y and Z) for enhancing invertebrate abundance?’</p><p>Or more specifically</p><p>‘What is the comparative effectiveness of field margin flower mixtures for enhancing pollinator abundance?’</p><p>Other areas that, although less highly populated with papers, may still enable systematic review analysis could include investigations into the impacts of ploughing and other tillage on invertebrates, and the impacts of grazing intensity on invertebrates. Comparisons of farming system were less frequent and appeared to be disparate – possibly making these questions less suitable for further analysis.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec32">Limitations of the systematic map</h3><p>The high volume of this literature found in this exercise demonstrates the size of this topic. Time, manpower and financial constraints precluded study of the full texts. The broad topic also complicated compilation of the database.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec33">Limitations during searching</h3><p>• Invertebrates and farmland birds were specified in the search terms as indicators of biodiversity at the request of the stakeholders. Amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and plants were not, but were still included in the systematic map database where found.</p><p>• The databases used in the searching phase, document publications starting after a particular date/year, so the results will not include a comprehensive assessment of earlier articles.</p><p>• The search was limited to literature published in English, and some of the databases were compiled for UK usage. This will have resulted in an international bias.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec34">Limitations during the exclusion phase</h3><p>• Exclusion of references was based upon the abstract only, due to the volume of literature captured, and so depended upon the detail provided. Some important information will be missing, and other information may be misleading.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec35">Limitations in interpretation</h3><p>• Counting studies may imply either that there is an ‘evidence gap’, or that there is a large amount of research for a subtopic, but does not consider the quality and robustness of studies and so could be misleading (i.e. a small quality of high quality studies will provide more robust evidence than a large number of low quality studies.)</p><p>• As no quality appraisal of research has taken place in this systematic map, we have deliberately not indicated whether individual studies reported a positive or negative impact of interventions on the studied outcome (i.e. biodiversity). Users of the map are advised to read the papers relevant to the intervention or organism of interest in order to assess their quality and robustness.</p><p>• Ponds were excluded (the one reference to ponds was included because riparian buffer strips were also studied). This will have affected the number of wetland taxa studies included.</p><p>• There may appear to be research gaps for some topic areas due to incomplete reporting within the abstracts of included studies.</p><p>• The summary statistics report the number of articles rather than the number of studies for each topic area. This may bias the number of results found in favour of those with multiple outputs of one study.</p><p>• Coding of each study was carried out independently for each factor. For some factors, false relationships will be indicated. For example, where a study investigated more than one biotope, specific management options will show for all biotopes investigated (<i>e.g.</i> cutting of field margins may be specific to them, but if other biotopes such as hedgerows were included in the same study, the independent coding would imply that cutting was also studied for hedgerows.)</p><p>• Keywording should accurately reflect the range of topics in the field. However, names for interventions, such as agri-environment scheme options, have changed historically, and vary between regions and schemes. This should be taken into consideration when searching the database.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec36"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec36-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec36">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec36-content"><p>This systematic map provides a large database of research on the primary topic: ‘The effectiveness of Integrated Farm Management, Organic farming and Agri-environment Schemes as interventions for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe, with an emphasis on birds and invertebrates’, subject to the limitations described. The map is up-to-date to June 2010 (with the exception of the Conservation Evidence search carried out in September 2010).</p><p>More studies were included in the final map than would have been in a systematic review, but full data extraction and critical evaluation of the included papers was not carried out. Papers are listed as either correlative or manipulative, and where available, basic experimental design is also shown in the database. Beyond this there is no indication of the quality of the papers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec37">Implications for policy and management</h3><p>The map provides a research tool for users interested in this topic area. It can be used to gather information on a wide array of sub-topics that can be cross-tabulated. As the map does not include quality appraisal or data synthesis of studies, users should retrieve the full text copies of studies of interest in order to assess them fully.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec38">Implications for future farmland biodiversity research</h3><p>The systematic map highlights a variety of areas for which there appear to be evidence gaps. Some potential questions to be investigated by further primary research include:</p><p>‘How effective are agri-environment options in providing for amphibians and reptiles?’</p><p>‘How effective are agri-environment schemes under differing farming systems?’</p><p>It would also be useful for more research to investigate the impacts of farming interventions on biodiversity in Eastern European countries, as research appeared to be generally lacking for these regions.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec39">Implications for future systematic maps</h3><p>This systematic map was one of the first of its kind in environmental management and a number of implications for future systematic maps in the field have arisen. Systematic maps have the ability to provide a useful tool to investigate wider topic areas than systematic review, and potential to include non-experimental evidence. For example, in this case we have included correlative studies that may not be suitable for systematic review analysis. It may also be feasible to include in systematic maps, research that, for example, investigates the costs of interventions, where this may be of use to decision makers. In order to make systematic maps more robust for the future, it may be usful to include ways in which to critically evaluate studies. As this study has illustrated, questions that are too broad or disparate can cause issues of repeatability with systematic maps as well as with systematic reviews.</p><p>As systematic mapping for environmental evidence is new, different approaches are likely to be used by different authors. A Systematic Mapping Methods group hosted by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence has been established to evaluate their use in the evidence-based framework for ecology and conservation, and will attempt to deal with some of the issues that have arisen.</p></div></div></section>
