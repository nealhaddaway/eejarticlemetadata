        <title>What are the impacts of reindeer/caribou ( Rangifer tarandus L.) on arctic and alpine vegetation? A systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus L.) has a natural range extending over much of Eurasia&#8217;s and North America&#8217;s arctic, alpine and boreal zones, yet its impact on vegetation is still unclear. This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="What are the impacts of reindeer/caribou ( Rangifer tarandus L.) on arctic and alpine vegetation? A systematic review"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus L.) has a natural range extending over much of Eurasia’s and North America’s arctic, alpine and boreal zones, yet its impact on vegetation is still unclear. This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood."/>

This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an <i>a priori</i> protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood.</p></div></div></section>

In considerable parts of this region, reindeer are the only large herbivores. In the 20th century, the species was also introduced into several areas where it never occurred naturally, including a number of islands in the Arctic and South Atlantic.</p><p><i>Rangifer tarandus</i> is the only species of the genus <i>Rangifer</i>, but it includes several subspecies. The Eurasian subspecies are referred to as reindeer, while those native to North America generally are known as caribou. We will normally use the term caribou only when specifically referring to studies from North America.</p><p>Wild reindeer are still numerous in parts of the world, notably in Canada and Alaska. In northern Europe and Siberia, however, the majority of reindeer populations have been domesticated or semi-domesticated for several centuries. Here, they are herded by indigenous and local peoples. Some large populations of wild reindeer are still present in Russia, and a few small ones remain in southern Norway and southeastern Finland, but in Sweden all reindeer are semi-domesticated.</p><p>Over the seasons, many reindeer herds migrate over large distances between summer and winter pastures, and between pastures with different vegetation within the seasonal ranges. Reindeer in Sweden normally spend the snow-free season foraging on alpine tundra, in the forest-tundra ecotone, or in subalpine birch forests, whereas they spend the winter in boreal coniferous forests.</p><p>The quality of the summer ranges are very important for the growth and condition of the reindeer, including how well they can survive subsequent difficult winters. However, the quality of the winter pastures is usually a strong determining factor for the population size of reindeer [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Moen J, Andersen R, Illius AW.

The damage on the lichen heaths was caused by a change in seasonal grazing from winter to summer, with lichens being worst affected due to their sensitivity to trampling during the snow-free season, whereas the reduction of palatable vascular plants was an effect of increased reindeer numbers.</p><p>More recently, however, the impact of reindeer grazing on mountain vegetation was subject to re-evaluation in Sweden. Analyses of available data on reindeer numbers and grazing effects indicated that the fears of overgrazing were based on local damage around a few enclosures and fences. Some of the effects were due to trampling on lichen-dominated vegetation, while others involved vegetation dominated by vascular plants, but no evidence of large-scale overutilisation of reindeer ranges in the Swedish mountains could be found [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Moen J, Danell Ö.

However, no details have been given on how this specification is to be interpreted in ecological terms.

It is not clear how this translates into a ‘landscape characterised by grazing’.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Rationale for a systematic review</h3><p>The variation in the impacts of reindeer on vegetation between studies and regions demonstrates that it is challenging to predict the ecological consequences of various forms of management of both domesticated and wild reindeer populations. The lack of a comprehensive assessment of how vegetation is affected by reindeer suggests that there is a need to evaluate the ecological significance of reindeer grazing through a systematic review.</p><p>In Sweden especially, the recent re-evaluation of what reindeer grazing means for arctic and alpine vegetation is another reason why it is imperative to examine the scientific support for today’s prevailing opinions on this issue. The need to interpret and clarify the environmental quality objective for the Swedish mountains also contributed to the decision to launch the present review.</p><p>In this review, we use a systematic approach to synthesise available evidence on the impacts of reindeer herbivory. Systematic reviews are designed to avoid bias and permit quantitative conclusions by means of meta-analysis. The ultimate aim of this review is to facilitate evidence-based management of reindeer grazing systems, with a particular focus on Fennoscandian conditions.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no systematic review of how reindeer grazing affects vegetation in treeless areas has been performed earlier. Our review was designed to include studies from any arctic or alpine region where reindeer are present, either as native or as introduced populations, provided that the data are informative for Fennoscandian conditions (e.g. by referring to vegetation types similar to those found in Fennoscandia).

Several suggestions made by the stakeholders were adopted by the review team, e.g. that the review should not be restricted to impacts on biodiversity but should consider other aspects of vegetation too, and that it should include vegetation in subalpine birch forests as well as treeless mountain areas. We have thus covered studies on treelines and on the forest-tundra ecotone, including subalpine birch forests but not coniferous forests at lower elevations.

The following search strings were used:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p><i>English:</i> (herbivory OR graz* OR brows* OR trampl*) AND (reindeer OR caribou OR <i>Rangifer</i>)</p></li><li><p><i>Swedish:</i> renbet* OR ((herbivori OR bet* OR tramp*) AND (renar OR caribou OR <i>Rangifer</i>))</p></li><li><p><i>Norwegian:</i> reinbeit* OR renbeit* OR ((beit* OR gressing OR tramp*) AND (*rein OR *ren OR reinsdyr OR rensdyr OR karibu OR caribou OR <i>Rangifer</i>))</p></li><li><p><i>Finnish:</i> (laidun* OR tallata OR talloa OR polkea) AND (poro OR <i>Rangifer</i>)</p></li><li><p><i>Russian:</i> (пастбище OR пастись OR выпасать OR выбирать OR высматривать OR вытаптывать) AND (олень OR оленеводство)</p></li></ul>
<p>No time, language or document type restrictions were applied.</p><p>In addition to the exposure and agent terms mentioned above, the following terms for ‘subject’ had been tested during the scoping exercise:</p><blockquote class="c-blockquote"><div class="c-blockquote__body"><p>vegetation, vascular, plant*, herb*, forb*, gramin*, lichen*, moss*, bryophyte*, flora, shrub*, tree*, forage, tundra, alpine, subalpine, arctic, subarctic, heath*, pasture*, rangeland*</p></div></blockquote>
<p>However, it was found that searches using the exposure and agent terms alone were specific enough to return a fully manageable amount of articles. Including the above subject terms would have restricted the search and reduced the number of hits by a factor of about two. The subject terms were therefore excluded – the loss of specificity was judged to be less important than the increase of sensitivity.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec14">Publication databases</h4><p>The search included the following online publication databases:</p><ol class="u-list-style-none"><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">1)</span><p>Academic Search Premier</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">2)</span><p>Agricola</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">3)</span><p>Arctic &amp; Antarctic Regions (EBSCOhost)</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">4)</span><p>Arto (reference database of Finnish articles)</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">5)</span><p>Biological Abstracts</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">6)</span><p>BioOne</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">7)</span><p>COPAC</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">8)</span><p>Directory of Open-Access Journals</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">9)</span><p>GEOBASE and GeoRef (Engineering Village)</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">10)</span><p>IngentaConnect</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">11)</span><p>JSTOR</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">12)</span><p>Melinda (union catalogue of Finnish libraries)</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">13)</span><p>Scopus</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">14)</span><p>SpringerLink</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">15)</span><p>SwePub (academic publications at Swedish universities)</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">16)</span><p>Web of Science</p></li><li><span class="u-custom-list-number">17)</span><p>Wiley Online Library</p></li></ol>

This file also contains a list of articles that we failed to find in full text.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec21">Study inclusion criteria</h4><p>Each study had to pass each of the following criteria in order to be included at any of the screening stages:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p><i>Relevant subject(s):</i> Vegetation in alpine/subalpine areas or arctic/subarctic tundra, including the forest-tundra ecotone. Reindeer may also occur in boreal coniferous forests, but studies of vegetation in such regions were not included; nor were studies of reindeer herbivory on meadows formerly used for cattle or sheep grazing.</p></li><li><p><i>Relevant types of exposure:</i> Grazing, browsing or trampling by reindeer. Modern reindeer husbandry may also affect vegetation through disturbances caused by reindeer herders’ all-terrain vehicles, but such impacts are not considered by this review.</p></li><li><p><i>Relevant types of comparator:</i> Lower or no grazing, browsing or trampling.</p></li><li><p><i>Relevant types of outcome:</i> Change in cover, abundance, biomass, diversity (including species richness), structure, composition or productivity of vegetation. Studies of single plant species and of the soil seed bank were also included.</p></li><li><p><i>Relevant types of study:</i> Any primary field study comparing vegetation in areas and/or time periods with different degrees of reindeer herbivory. Remote-sensing studies have been included, but not simulation-modelling studies or field studies of simulated herbivory, since these do not represent direct impacts of reindeer.</p></li></ul>
<p>The review protocol indicated that manipulative studies as well as purely observational ones were to be considered. However, while we have included experiments where fences were used to keep reindeer out from certain areas, we have chosen to exclude studies involving artificial removal or transplantation of vegetation, again in order to focus on effects of reindeer herbivory under natural conditions. We have also excluded studies where differences in grazing pressure have been inferred from vegetation properties, since such conclusions would introduce circular reasoning if used in this review.</p><p>At screening on full text, the following inclusion criterion was also applied:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p><i>Language:</i> Full text written in English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, German or Russian.</p></li></ul>

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23">Study quality assessment</h3><p>Articles that remained included after full-text screening were subject to critical appraisal as described below. This appraisal was made by the four ecologists in the review team (KAB, BF, JM, JS) and double-checked by the fifth member of the team (CB). Uncertain cases were discussed and decided on by the entire team.</p><p>Before critical appraisal, the articles had been redistributed among the reviewers based on where the studies had been carried out. All studies from a specific region were assessed by the same reviewer, which made it easier to detect any redundancies between them.</p><p>Articles sorted under the categories listed below were considered to have high susceptibility to bias and were therefore excluded from the review.</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p><i>Methodology inadequately described</i>.</p></li><li><p><i>Inappropriate comparator</i> (comparison between different seasons, use of small-mesh exclosures that prevented grazing by small mammals as well as reindeer, or comparator difficult to interpret for the purposes of this review). Studies that compare grazing in different seasons have usually been made in areas where summer and winter ranges are separated by a fence. Since the effects of grazing on bare and snow-covered ground are entirely different, such a study design makes it difficult to judge which of the two ranges that is more heavily grazed, even if reindeer densities are known in both of them.</p></li><li><p><i>No replication at lowest level</i> (no replication of exclosures or site comparators). Studies based on comparison of so-called reindeer-herding districts or regions have not been excluded, however, even though study units representing such a district may be seen as pseudoreplicates in a strict statistical sense. Since the study units represent different geographical contexts within the district and thus also differ in terms of biology and reindeer impact, the interpretation of them as pseudoreplicates is not justified in an ecological sense.</p></li><li><p><i>No data on variability</i>.</p></li><li><p><i>Vegetation data difficult to interpret</i> (such as when methods used to assess vegetation have differed between sites or sampling seasons).</p></li><li><p><i>Reindeer data difficult to interpret</i> (such as when conclusions on the presence of reindeer have been based on weak and circumstantial evidence)<i>.</i>
</p></li></ul>
<p>Since checks for redundancy were made during critical appraisal, this was added as a cause for exclusion, although it is not strictly a quality criterion:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p><i>Primary data redundant</i> (data also published elsewhere).</p></li></ul>
<p>In accordance with the review protocol, notes were also made on certain other quality aspects (such as whether plot locations were randomised and well-matched or not), but since these aspects were considered less important than those listed above, they were not chosen as exclusion criteria. The duration of exposure differences (i.e. how long differences of grazing pressure had been maintained) was recorded too, but it was handled as a potential effect modifier rather than a measure of study quality.</p><p>According to the review protocol, studies were to be categorised as having high, medium, or low susceptibility to bias based on the critical appraisal. However, since we adopted fairly strict exclusion criteria, there seemed to be no need for a further quality grading of studies that fulfilled quality standards well enough to remain included.</p><p>A list of the studies that were rejected due to high susceptibility to bias is provided in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-014-0030-3#MOESM2">2</a> together with the reasons for exclusion.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24">Data extraction strategy</h3><p>Outcome means and measures of variation (standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals) have been extracted from tables and graphs in the included articles, using image analysis software when necessary (software used included Graphclick for Mac, <a href="http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/">http://www.arizona-software.ch/graphclick/</a>, and WebPlotDigitizer, <a href="http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/">http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/</a>). Data were extracted not only on major functional or taxonomic groups of vegetation and on vegetation as a whole, but also on individual species and genera whenever such information was available.</p><p>Most studies in this field compare vegetation in areas that for a long time have been subject to different levels of reindeer herbivory, or vegetation inside and outside areas that have been fenced to exclude reindeer. Thus, they are usually ‘CI’ (Comparator/Intervention) studies describing effects of reindeer herbivory relative to a control site. Other studies have a ‘BA’ (Before/After) design – they present data on vegetation before and after reindeer exclusion or over a period when herbivory has changed. A few studies combine these two approaches in ‘BACI’ (Before/After/Comparator/Intervention) designs, where site control and intervention comparisons are made both before and after herbivory has changed.</p><p>Where time-series of data were available, we only extracted the most recent results (plus pre-intervention data from BA and BACI studies). Similarly, we only extracted data from sites under high and low grazing pressure even if data from sites under intermediate pressure were also available.</p><p>In a few cases, study authors have been asked to supply vegetation data in digital format. This was done where useful data had been published in graphs from which they were difficult to extract accurately enough, or when it was known or assumed that considerable amounts of relevant but unpublished data could be available in addition to the published results. In cases where raw data were received, summary statistics have been calculated by us. This has e.g. enabled us to consider data on the diversity of vegetation even from studies where the published outcomes only include biomass or abundance.</p><p>Data on potential effect modifiers and other metadata were extracted from the included articles whenever available, but climatic data were downloaded from the WorldClim database [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 55" title="Hijmans RJ, Cameron SE, Parra JL, Jones PG, Jarvis A.

Many of these studies simply describe sampling sites as being subject to ‘grazing’ or ‘no (or lighter) grazing’. Some authors have actually estimated local reindeer densities, using counts of animals, trampling indicators or counts of reindeer droppings, but the two latter types of data cannot readily be transformed to reindeer numbers per unit area.</p><p>In the absence of reliable local information, therefore, we have used data on average reindeer densities at a regional level (e.g. mean densities in entire reindeer-herding districts). Where such data were not provided by study authors, we have calculated them ourselves for the appropriate time periods using herd sizes and range sizes retrieved from external sources, such as Reindriftsforvaltningen (the Norwegian reindeer herding administration) and Svensk-norska renbeteskommissionen (the Swedish-Norwegian commission on reindeer pastures). We are well aware that these data must be used and interpreted with care, since herding districts may cover thousands of square kilometres and a study site may be far from representative of average conditions in the district where it is located.</p><p>The extraction of data was carried out by the four ecologists in the review team and then double-checked by the fifth team member. Each pair of BA or CI outcomes (and each quadruple of BACI outcomes) was recorded in a separate row of an Excel spreadsheet together with data on reindeer densities and all appropriate metadata, including data on effect modifiers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25">Data synthesis and presentation</h3><p>The impacts of reindeer exposure on vegetation were analysed using meta-analytical approaches.

Standardised mean difference (SMD) effect sizes were derived for all responses using Hedges’ <i>g</i> statistic. The effect sizes were calculated as the difference between the mean response at high exposure to reindeer and the mean response at low exposure to reindeer divided by the pooled standard deviation. Positive effect sizes thus indicate that the response parameter was higher at high reindeer exposure than at low exposure.</p><p>We calculated summary effect sizes by using random effects models. Models were developed for the main groups of vegetation (lichens, bryophytes, forbs/herbs, graminoids and woody plants) and the most common aspects of vegetation assessed (cover, abundance, biomass, height and productivity) as well as for bare-ground cover and species richness of vascular and non-vascular plants. Where applicable, subgroup models were developed for further vegetation groups within each of the main groups (e.g. for deciduous and evergreen shrubs). Heterogeneity was estimated by the Hedges’ method, and data are presented in forest plots showing mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals. Models were weighted by the inverse of the variance.</p><p>We used univariate mixed effects models in order to test whether the impact of reindeer exposure on vegetation varied with reindeer density, vegetation cover or mean annual temperature. The independent variables were fitted as modifiers in the meta-analytical models. Four separate measures of reindeer density were used: (1) the high-exposure reindeer density, (2) the absolute difference in reindeer density between high and low exposures, (3) the relative difference in reindeer density (100 × [high density – low density] / high density) and (4) the accumulated exposure difference estimated as the absolute difference in reindeer density multiplied by the duration of the exposure difference. We investigated whether the impact of reindeer exposure varied with the cover of lichens and bare ground only, as there was not enough data to do this for other vegetation groups. Lichen and bare-ground cover effect sizes were fitted against the average cover of lichens and bare ground (meaning that the standardised mean difference in lichen cover was used as the dependent variable and the average lichen cover across both exposures as the independent variable).</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec26"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec26-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec26">Results</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec26-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27">Review descriptive statistics</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec28">Searches, screening and quality assessment</h4><p>The main searches for literature were conducted between 19 October and 8 December 2012, and an update was made on 2 November 2013.</p><p>Full-text searches with English search terms in three publication databases (Academic Search Premier, JSTOR and Scopus) returned a total of 8,039 articles (6,638 after removal of duplicates).

Removal of the overlap between the outcomes of the two different search approaches left a total of 1,197 unique publications.

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec29">Sources of included articles</h4><p>Nearly all of the 40 articles included in this review were found in publication databases. Of the 39 included publications that had been identified during the main searches in late 2012, 37 were returned by at least one of the databases searched (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-014-0030-3#MOESM4">4</a>).</p><p>The three publication databases where full-text searches had been made were also searched based on title/abstract/keywords.

<p>As a consequence of the uneven geographic distribution of the studies, the majority (26 of them) dealt with herbivory by native Eurasian reindeer (<i>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</i>), either semi-domesticated or wild. The North American studies were all concerned with wild caribou (<i>R. t. caribou</i> or <i>R. t. groenlandicus</i>). The reindeer on Svalbard (<i>R. t. platyrhynchus</i>) are wild and native to the archipelago, but one of the studies conducted there (Hansen <i>et al.</i> [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Hansen BB, Henriksen S, Aanes R, Sæther B-E.

<p>Nearly 80% of the extracted data refer to single species rather than functional or taxonomic groups of vegetation, but an individual species was rarely covered by more than 1–3 of the included studies. For that reason, we eventually decided not to analyse single-species data in this review. Instead, we have focused on the 455 comparisons of vegetational groups that were available.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31">Narrative synthesis</h3><p>We begin with a narrative synthesis in order to provide context and background for the quantitative meta-analyses that follow.

<p>Indeed, the effect of reindeer on lichen cover was negatively related to average lichen cover, whilst the effect of reindeer on bare-ground cover was positively related to average bare-ground cover (Figure <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-014-0030-3#Fig10">10</a>).

For instance, wild reindeer had a negative effect on lichen cover (SMD: −3.85, CI: −7.17, −0.53; 5 studies), while semi-domesticated reindeer had strongly varying effects ranging from negative to positive, giving a mean effect size of zero (CI: −0.10, 0.11).

However, we did identify a few patterns. 1) We did not find strong evidence that reduction of shrubs by reindeer is a general phenomenon. 2) The overall effect of reindeer on graminoids was neutral, indicating that this supposedly grazing-tolerant growth form is not always promoted by reindeer grazing. 3) We found a reduction of forbs, despite the typically low abundance of this growth form. This indicates that forbs are both highly selected by reindeer and vulnerable. They may be an important indicator group of vascular plants. 4) We were able to corroborate the many studies showing that lichens are vulnerable to reindeer activities. 5) Bryophytes were not vulnerable to reindeer exposure.</p><p>In conclusion, the effect of reindeer grazing on arctic-alpine vegetation appears to be context-dependent. What, then, could cause this context dependence, i.e. what can explain the heterogeneity of our results?</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec38">Reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>The distribution of reindeer encompasses large environmental gradients, ranging from low-productive to highly productive sites, from dry to wet environments and from forests to high alpine tundra, with an entire vegetation mosaic being present within these gradients. All different vegetation types that occur here cannot be expected to respond in the same way to grazing and trampling. For instance, Proulx &amp; Mazumder [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 71" title="Proulx M, Mazumder A. Reversal of grazing impact on plant species richness in nutrient-poor vs. nutrient-rich ecosystems. Ecology. 1998;79:2581–92." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-014-0030-3#ref-CR71" id="ref-link-section-d81407e3787">71</a>] showed that species richness tended to decline under grazing at low-productive sites, but increase at more productive sites. This is mirrored in our study, where vascular-plant species richness was found to be related to mean temperature. Further, the studies included in our analysis ranged from dry ridge vegetation to riparian herb meadows and mesic birch forests, with many different plant communities occurring within those vegetation types. Unfortunately, there was not enough replication at this scale, nor enough consistency in the presentation of plant communities, to analyse grazing effects for each community type.</p><p>Seasonality in grazing may also affect the results, especially if grazing in snow-covered terrain is included. However, only about 4% of the data that we extracted concerned winter grazing, and most of these data were not used in the meta-analyses since they referred to responses of single species. It is thus unlikely that differences in seasonal grazing can explain the heterogeneity we found.</p><p>Variations in management systems may be another reason for heterogeneity. Our dataset encompasses impacts of both wild and semi-domesticated reindeer, but with a strong bias towards semi-domesticated herds (&gt;90% of the extracted data). However, management systems were confounded with the initial vegetation state; for instance, wild reindeer tended to occur in areas with high lichen cover, which precluded us from testing their influence on the outcomes. Even among semi-domesticated herds, management systems vary considerably. Reindeer husbandry operates under many different drivers, forms of legislation, market situations and historical legacies within and between different countries. Grazing pressure may thus vary strongly between different herding districts and systems.</p><p>It has been suggested that reindeer have relatively small and subtle overall effects on vegetation in summer grounds. Estimates of biomass removal vary from 0.6% to 2% of net primary productivity, and such levels are unlikely to cause large changes in the vegetation [e.g. 1]. The reasons for the low overall effects could include a decoupling of population dynamics and food resources in the more forage-abundant season, [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Moen J, Andersen R, Illius AW.

Reindeer numbers are generally determined by winter resources, and the summer resources constitute a pulse of plant biomass growth that the reindeer populations cannot fully respond to. However, reindeer do not use the landscape randomly, and grazing pressure may be much higher than average in preferred sites and vegetation types. For instance, Bråthen &amp; Oksanen [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 73" title="Bråthen KA, Oksanen J.

Ranging from evergreen, allelopathic species such as <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> to deciduous ericoids, <i>Betula nana</i> and species of <i>Salix,</i> the woody plants can be sorted in categories of palatability to reindeer, and hence they are likely to be differentially affected by reindeer herbivory.

This, together with the lack of a common research protocol (researchers have measured several aspects of vegetation in dissimilar ways), makes it difficult to summarise results across all studies included in our systematic review. For instance, we found data on 16 different types of species groupings among woody plants (including e.g. non-forage shrubs and deciduous ericoids). When combined with different methods of measuring vegetation (abundance, cover, and biomass), this resulted in 23 different subgroups in the meta-analysis. These kinds of study-specific subgroupings and methodologies limit our ability to disentangle under what circumstances reindeer have positive, neutral or negative effects on various aspects of vegetation. This is not a trivial problem, since there are also large environmental and social gradients that need to be addressed.</p><p>The studies included in our review are fairly recent (mostly dating from 2000 or later). We have very little data from extended experiments based on true replication that could help us to examine the long-term effects of reindeer herbivory. The included studies are also limited both geographically and in terms of vegetation types, and thus not representative of the distribution of reindeer. Most of the data come from tundra sites, and the database is weak on effects on treelines and subalpine forests.</p><p>Most of the studies have merely categorised reindeer densities or grazing pressures at treatment and control sites as high or low, without attempting to quantify them further.

The included studies are not standardised and representative enough that they can be used as a basis for specific recommendations regarding reindeer ranges in Sweden, nor in the circumpolar region as a whole.</p><p>However, an important point that we can make is that vegetation responses to reindeer grazing are context-dependent. For instance, the differential effects of reindeer on vegetation found in this review are most likely due to the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history, just to mention a few important factors. This suggests that there is no panacea that can cover all combinations of factors. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec42">Implication for research and monitoring</h3><p>It is unlikely that further research will be able to improve the evidence base much unless a more rigorous research protocol, specifically aimed at the questions raised in this review, becomes generally accepted and implemented. We provide some suggestions for achieving this:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Adopt a standardised way of aggregating plant species into growth forms and/or functional groups.</p></li><li><p>Agree on the aspects of vegetation (biomass, abundance or cover) that should have priority.</p></li><li><p>Adopt common measures of vegetation.</p></li><li><p>Develop common measures of reindeer densities and grazing/browsing and trampling pressures.</p></li><li><p>Implement the protocol in monitoring programs as well as in specific research programs.</p></li><li><p>Be very clear in the methods section of an article on how the experiment has been done, and include more information in table and figure captions (such as the number of replicates that the means are based on, and the type of variation that is shown).</p></li><li><p>Deposit raw data in public data repositories.</p></li><li><p>Include some measure of plant productivity.</p></li><li><p>Include some measure of plant palatability and plant nutrition status.</p></li><li><p>If possible, adopt a gradient approach to investigate variations in responses.</p></li><li><p>External factors, such as the history of land use and reindeer husbandry, should be carefully documented for each study site.</p></li></ul>
