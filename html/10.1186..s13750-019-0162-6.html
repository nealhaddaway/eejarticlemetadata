        <title>The effectiveness of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning temperate fish: a systematic review | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For fish that require substrate for spawning, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to population collapse. To ensure management resources are being allocated wisely and conservation targets are being achieved, there is an increased need to consider the effectiveness of techniques to enhance or create habitat that has been lost. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate-spawning (including vegetation-spawning) fish in temperate regions, and to investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement. Searches for primary research studies on the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning fish were conducted in bibliographic databases, on websites and an online search engine, through evidence call-outs, social media, and Advisory Team contacts, and in the bibliographies of relevant reviews. All articles were screened at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text), with consistency checks being performed at each stage. Relevant articles were critically appraised and meta-data and quantitative data were extracted into a database. All included studies were described narratively and studies that met the criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed quantitatively. A total of 75 studies from 64 articles were included in this systematic review and underwent data extraction and critical appraisal. The majority of these studies were from North America (78.1%) and a large percentage (63.7%) targeted salmonids. We conducted&#160;a meta-analysis using data from 22 studies with 53 data sets. Available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., gravel, cobble) was effective in increasing the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls, with a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (5/6 data sets). The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris) with or without physical alterations to the waterbody (e.g., excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to controls. Egg life stages (i.e., nests, redds, zygotes or developing embryos) were associated with larger increases in abundance with habitat creation or enhancement than age-0 life stages (i.e., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year). We found no detectable effect of ecosystem type (lotic vs. lentic waterbodies) or time since habitat creation or enhancement on intervention effectiveness for fish abundance. The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addition of gravel, substrate washing) was an effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, the synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance. Overall, we were limited in our ability to address many of the questions that stakeholders have regarding the circumstances under which&#160;spawning habitat creation or enhancement is effective for substrate-spawning fish. Before we can provide recommendations with a higher level of certainty, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand research focus to include a broader range of species and intervention types. We provide several recommendations aimed at researchers and practitioners to improve the quality of evidence being generated."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="The effectiveness of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning temperate fish: a systematic review"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For fish that require substrate for spawning, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to population collapse. To ensure management resources are being allocated wisely and conservation targets are being achieved, there is an increased need to consider the effectiveness of techniques to enhance or create habitat that has been lost. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate-spawning (including vegetation-spawning) fish in temperate regions, and to investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement. Searches for primary research studies on the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning fish were conducted in bibliographic databases, on websites and an online search engine, through evidence call-outs, social media, and Advisory Team contacts, and in the bibliographies of relevant reviews. All articles were screened at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text), with consistency checks being performed at each stage. Relevant articles were critically appraised and meta-data and quantitative data were extracted into a database. All included studies were described narratively and studies that met the criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed quantitatively. A total of 75 studies from 64 articles were included in this systematic review and underwent data extraction and critical appraisal. The majority of these studies were from North America (78.1%) and a large percentage (63.7%) targeted salmonids. We conducted&amp;nbsp;a meta-analysis using data from 22 studies with 53 data sets. Available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., gravel, cobble) was effective in increasing the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls, with a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (5/6 data sets). The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris) with or without physical alterations to the waterbody (e.g., excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to controls. Egg life stages (i.e., nests, redds, zygotes or developing embryos) were associated with larger increases in abundance with habitat creation or enhancement than age-0 life stages (i.e., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year). We found no detectable effect of ecosystem type (lotic vs. lentic waterbodies) or time since habitat creation or enhancement on intervention effectiveness for fish abundance. The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addition of gravel, substrate washing) was an effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, the synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance. Overall, we were limited in our ability to address many of the questions that stakeholders have regarding the circumstances under which&amp;nbsp;spawning habitat creation or enhancement is effective for substrate-spawning fish. Before we can provide recommendations with a higher level of certainty, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand research focus to include a broader range of species and intervention types. We provide several recommendations aimed at researchers and practitioners to improve the quality of evidence being generated."/>

For fish that require substrate for spawning, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to population collapse. To ensure management resources are being allocated wisely and conservation targets are being achieved, there is an increased need to consider the effectiveness of techniques to enhance or create habitat that has been lost. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate-spawning (including vegetation-spawning) fish in temperate regions, and to investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>Searches for primary research studies on the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning fish were conducted in bibliographic databases, on websites and an online search engine, through evidence call-outs, social media, and Advisory Team contacts, and in the bibliographies of relevant reviews. All articles were screened at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text), with consistency checks being performed at each stage. Relevant articles were critically appraised and meta-data and quantitative data were extracted into a database. All included studies were described narratively and studies that met the criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed quantitatively.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Review findings</h3><p>A total of 75 studies from 64 articles were included in this systematic review and underwent data extraction and critical appraisal. The majority of these studies were from North America (78.1%) and a large percentage (63.7%) targeted salmonids. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 22 studies with 53 data sets. Available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., gravel, cobble) was effective in increasing the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls, with a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (5/6 data sets). The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris) with or without physical alterations to the waterbody (e.g., excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to controls. Egg life stages (i.e., nests, redds, zygotes or developing embryos) were associated with larger increases in abundance with habitat creation or enhancement than age-0 life stages (i.e., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year). We found no detectable effect of ecosystem type (lotic vs. lentic waterbodies) or time since habitat creation or enhancement on intervention effectiveness for fish abundance.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addition of gravel, substrate washing) was an effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, the synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance. Overall, we were limited in our ability to address many of the questions that stakeholders have regarding the circumstances under which spawning habitat creation or enhancement is effective for substrate-spawning fish. Before we can provide recommendations with a higher level of certainty, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand research focus to include a broader range of species and intervention types. We provide several recommendations aimed at researchers and practitioners to improve the quality of evidence being generated.</p></div></div></section>

Creation or enhancement of spawning habitat is often used to mitigate or offset the destruction/degradation of spawning substrate, though may also be used to simply enhance habitat. However, to be suitable for a target species, spawning habitat must have specific properties matched to the species’ ecological niche, not all of which may be known to practitioners. Thus, there is much interest in identifying the extent to which spawning habitat creation or enhancement interventions are effective at increasing population size or productivity of substrate-spawning fish. Identifying the extent to which spawning habitat creation or enhancement interventions are effective is of particular interest in temperate regions where substrate-spawning species such as salmonids (e.g., Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lake trout), centrarchids (e.g., black bass), percids (e.g., walleye), and ictalurids (e.g., brown bullhead) are common, and in jurisdictions, such as Canada, that have well-developed regulatory frameworks for habitat protection and restoration.</p><p>Some of the most common restoration or enhancement measures for spawning habitat include additions of instream structures, such as large woody debris, boulders/cobbles, logs jams, and brush bundles [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Roni P, Beechie T, Pess G, Hanson K.

Herein, substrate-spawning will include both substrate- and vegetation-spawning fish (e.g., northern pike as an example of a vegetation-spawning fish). The relevant subjects included all fish from egg (i.e., zygote or developing embryo) and larval stage (i.e., yolk sac larval stage) to age-0 (e.g., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year [YOY] that are no longer dependent on a yolk sac) as well as spawning adults. A decision was made by the Advisory Team to modify the criteria described in the protocol [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Taylor JJ, Rytwinski T, Bennett JR, Smokorowski KE, Cooke SJ.

This decision was made to ensure the focus of this review remained on effectiveness of spawning habitat and not nursery/rearing habitat. Therefore, any non-spawning fish described by authors as older than 1 year (e.g., age 1+, smolt) was excluded. One could argue that some age-0 fish may not be a using the habitat as spawning habitat, but rather using it as nursery habitat. However, we assumed because some researchers measured age-0 fish as the response to a spawning habitat creation or enhancement that this was a relevant and/or preferred age to measure the response. For instance, salmonids do not emerge from gravel redds until the yolk sac has been fully absorbed; hanging around redds for many weeks because of the protection provided by the spawning substrate. Once the yolk sac has been absorbed, fry relocate to more amenable nursery habitat. Researchers often set emergence traps on the spawning substrate to confirm successful salmonid egg development, and thus the traps would capture fry during emergence before relocation to nursery habitat (e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Gebhards SY.

Also, a common technique for lake sturgeon (<i>Acipenser fulvescens</i>) spawning habitat assessment is to set larval drift nets immediately below spawning substrate to capture drifting fry seeking more amenable habitat than the spawning shoal, and confirm successful egg development (e.g., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Caroffino DC, Sutton TM, Daugherty DJ.

The framework used to assess study validity was reviewed by the Advisory Team to ensure that it accurately reflected the characteristics of an ideal study, regardless of resources or experimental/field restrictions. For example, in the case of habitat restoration, a high number of true replicates is not always feasible, due to spatial or financial constraints, and is therefore uncommon. After input from the Advisory Team, a sample size of n &gt; 5 true replicates was deemed ‘high’ validity, while n = 2–5 was considered ‘medium’ and more feasible in the real world, and unreplicated was considered ‘low’ validity. Studies that provided only a count/number with no variance or presented a mean and variance across years and did not have replication within a year were considered unreplicated.

The internal validity criteria included: study design (BA, CI, or BACI), replication (true or pseudoreplication), control matching [how well matched the intervention and comparator sites were at site selection and/or study initiation (e.g., physical characteristics)], measured outcome [quantitative, quantitative approximation (e.g., catch per unit effort, population estimates), semi-quantitative (e.g., absence before intervention and abundance data after intervention), or qualitative], and confounding factors [environmental or other factors that differ between intervention and comparator sites and/or times, that occur after site selection and/or study initiation (e.g., flood, drought, unplanned human alteration)]. Each criterion was scored as ‘high’ (low risk of bias), ‘medium’ (medium risk of bias), or ‘low’ (high risk of bias) based on the predefined framework outlined in Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab1">1</a>. A study was given an overall ‘low’ validity if it scored low for one or more of the criteria. If the study did not score at least one low or all high for any of the criteria, it was assigned an overall ‘medium’ validity. Studies that scored only high for all of the criteria were assigned an overall ‘high’ validity. This approach assumes that equal weight was given to each criterion, which was carefully considered during the development of the predefined framework.</p><p>In most cases, study quality assessment and data extraction were performed simultaneously and by the same reviewer (JJT). If there was any uncertainty, another reviewer (TR) was brought into discuss and a consensus decision made. Initially, however, a consistency check was undertaken on 6/64 articles (9.4%) by JJT and TR. Meta-data and quality assessments on these studies were extracted by both reviewers, discrepancies were discussed and, when necessary, refinements to the meta-data extraction and quality assessment sheets were made to improve clarity on coding. Reviewers did not critically appraise studies for which they were an author.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20">Data coding and extraction strategy</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec21">General data-extraction strategy</h4><p>Following full-text assessment, all included articles underwent meta-data extraction, regardless of their study validity category. Data extraction used a review-specific data-extraction form (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM3">3</a>). Extracted information followed the general structure of our PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) and included characteristics such as: publication details, study location, study summary and timeline, population details, intervention and comparator details, and outcome variables. Abundance (including density, CPUE, and biomass), survival, and body size were treated as continuous outcome variables. Measures of abundance were used to address questions of broad differences in abundance, whereas survival and body size allowed understanding of the success and productivity of fisheries. For further syntheses, waterbody type was assessed as either (1) lotic (i.e., including: rivers, creeks, and sounds), or (2) lentic (including: lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs). During data extraction, redundant articles (i.e., articles that reported data that could also be found elsewhere or contained portions of information that could be used in combination with another more complete source) were identified and combined with the most comprehensive article (i.e., primary study source) (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM4">4</a>).

For instance, first, if a single article reported data separately for sites we considered as ecologically independent (i.e. different interventions were applied to a number of sites, each with their own controls), we regarded these studies as independent and assigned each study a separate “Site ID” (refer to Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab2">2</a> for term definitions).</p><p>A single independent study could also report separate relevant comparisons for: (1) different species, and/or (2) the same species but for different responses (i.e., abundance, survival, body size), or different interventions (i.e., rock material, plant material, waterbody creation/extension, waterbody modification, human-made structures). For quantitative synthesis, we treated these comparisons separately (i.e., separate rows in the database that share the same Site ID).</p><p>Replication within a study (i.e., group sample sizes) was considered at two levels: (1) independent intervention areas (i.e., separate waterbodies, or separate sections of a waterbody receiving treatment—true replicates), and (2) partly subsampled data, hereafter referred to as pseudoreplicated samples (i.e., in the sense that reported variances did not refer to the variability of true replicate means from (1) above but to the variability of subsamples within/across true replicates). For the former, we recorded the number of independent intervention areas as the level of true treatment replication. For the latter, we recorded the number of pseudoreplicated samples occurring, for example, at the plot or nest levels within an area (i.e., non-independent replicates). In cases of pseudoreplicated data (or presumed pseudoreplicated data), we made appropriate adjustments in the quantitative synthesis (see “Adjustment accounting for pseudoreplication”—Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM5">5</a>).</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec23">Data-extraction consistency checking</h4><p>As described above (see “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Sec19">Study validity assessment</a>”) in most cases, data extraction took place at the same time as the study quality assessment and by the same reviewer (JJT) after a consistency check was performed on a subset of the articles.

Beginning with Cohen’s d, the standardized mean difference was used to account for differences in the scale of measurement across studies by dividing the mean difference in each study (i.e., the difference between the mean response to an intervention and the mean response to no intervention) divided by that study’s pooled standard deviation:</p><div id="Equ1" class="c-article-equation"><div class="c-article-equation__content"><span class="mathjax-tex">$$d = \frac{{\bar{X}_{G2} - \bar{X}_{G1} }}{{S_{\text{pooled}} }}$$</span></div><div class="c-article-equation__number">

                    (2)
                </div></div><p>where <i>S</i> = standard deviation, and n<sub>G1</sub> and n<sub>G2</sub> were the sample sizes of group 1 and group 2.

                    (3)
                </div></div>
<p>To convert from Cohen’s <i>d</i> to Hedges’ <i>g,</i> we used a correction factor that removes small sample size bias:</p><div id="Equ4" class="c-article-equation"><div class="c-article-equation__content"><span class="mathjax-tex">$$J = \left[ {1 - \frac{3}{{4\left( {n_{G1} + n_{G2} - 2} \right) - 1}} } \right]$$</span></div><div class="c-article-equation__number">
                    (4)
                </div></div>
<p>Then Hedges’ <i>g</i> and associated variance (<i>V</i><sub><i>g</i></sub>) were calculated as:</p><div id="Equ5" class="c-article-equation"><div class="c-article-equation__content"><span class="mathjax-tex">$$Hedges' g = J \times d$$</span></div><div class="c-article-equation__number">

<div id="Equ6" class="c-article-equation"><div class="c-article-equation__content"><span class="mathjax-tex">$$V_{g} = J^{2} \times V_{d}$$</span></div><div class="c-article-equation__number">
                    (6)
                </div></div>
<p>Thus, a positive Hedges’ <i>g</i> indicates that the response outcome (abundance, survival, or body size) was higher/longer in the created or enhanced spawning habitat areas than in areas with no intervention.</p><h5 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31">Quantitative synthesis</h5><p>All meta-analyses were conducted in R 3.4.3 [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="R Development Core Team.

To further account for multiple study comparisons within a study site and species outcomes being reported from the same site (see “Combining data across outcomes or multiple comparisons within a study” in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM5">5</a> for full adjustment summary), Site ID was included as a random factor in each model. The summary effect size was considered to be significantly different from zero (i.e. there was a significant either positive or negative effect of intervention) when the 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not overlap zero. Heterogeneity in effects was calculated using the <i>Q</i> statistic, which was compared against the χ<sup>2</sup> distribution, to test whether the total variation in observed effect sizes (<i>Q</i><sub>T</sub>) was significantly greater than that expected from sampling error (<i>Q</i><sub>E</sub>) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Hedges LV, Olkin I. Statistical methods for meta-analysis. New York City: Academic Press; 1985." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d24457e1942">46</a>]. A statistically significant <i>Q</i> indicates greater heterogeneity in effect sizes (i.e., individual effect sizes do not estimate a common population mean), suggesting there are differences among effect sizes that have some cause other than sampling error. We also produced forest plots to visualize mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals from individual comparisons. The purpose of these summary effect sizes was to identify general trends in the evidence base. It is important to note, that a lack of significance does not indicate no significant patterns within the evidence base. Furthermore, a lack of significance can only be interpreted as a lack of evidence for an effect if there is no indication of heterogeneity. Additionally, if a significant pattern is detected within the evidence base, interpretation of summary effects should include some consideration for context. For example, if a significant positive summary effect of habitat creation or enhancement on fish abundance is detected, it should not necessarily be interpreted as evidence that any habitat creation or enhancement measure designed for substrate spawning fish will improve fish abundance.</p><p>Given that Hedges’ <i>g</i> may not be easily interpretable, we attempted to convert <i>g</i> to a weighted-mean percent change in intervention effectiveness by plotting the relationship between <i>g</i> and the percent change in intervention effectiveness:</p><div id="Equ7" class="c-article-equation"><div class="c-article-equation__content"><span class="mathjax-tex">$$\frac{{ \bar{X}_{G2} - \left( {\bar{X}_{G1} + q} \right)}}{{\bar{X}_{G1} + q}}*100,$$</span></div><div class="c-article-equation__number">

                </div></div><p>where <span class="mathjax-tex">\(\bar{X}_{G1}\)</span> and <span class="mathjax-tex">\(\bar{X}_{G2}\)</span> were the means of group 1 (G1 = comparator group) and group 2 (G2 = intervention group). Since percent change cannot be computed when <span class="mathjax-tex">\(\bar{X}_{G1}\)</span> = 0, we added a small constant <i>q </i>= 0.01 to <span class="mathjax-tex">\(\bar{X}_{G1}\)</span> for each data set. Also, because the calculation for percent change has no upper or lower bound, it can be excessively large when the comparator mean is small; to address this, we trim these extreme values by bounding the percent change to ± 100. For all analyses, we accompany weighted-mean effect sizes with weighted-mean percent changes and 95% confidence intervals from individual comparisons (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>). It should be noted that while this metric provides an indication of the relative proportional change in the intervention effectiveness, it is unclear, in a broad sense, how closely related this metric is to Hedges’ <i>g.</i> As such, this metric should only be used to aid with interpretation of effect size estimates.</p><p>Despite our effort to reduce publication bias by including data available in grey literature, the results could still be flawed if there was a bias towards publishing only positive or statistically significant results. Therefore, we examined the robustness of our models by testing for publication biases in two ways. First, we used visual assessments of funnel plots (i.e., scatter plots of the effect sizes of the included studies versus a measure of their precision e.g., sample size, standard error, or sampling variance) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Light RJ, Pillemer DB. Summing up: the science of reviewing research. Cambridge: Harvard University Press; 1984." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#ref-CR47" id="ref-link-section-d24457e2099">47</a>]. If no bias is present, the funnel plot should be funnel-shaped, with a wider spread of effect sizes for less precise (smaller) studies and decreasing spread as study precision increases (larger studies). We produced funnel plots using 1/square root of sample size, since standard errors have been shown to be inappropriate for funnel plots of standardized effect sizes [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 48" title="Zwetsloot PP, Van Der Naald M, Sena ES, Howells DW, IntHout J, De Groot JA, et al.

In these plots, as study sample size increases (1/sqrt(k) decreases) we should expect the variance in the effect size to decrease if no bias is present. Second, in an attempt to judge the robustness of results against publication bias, the fail-safe numbers were calculated using the method as described by Rosenberg [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Rosenberg MS.

The fail-safe number is often considered robust if it is greater than 5k + 10, where k is the number of effect sizes in the analysis (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Rosenthal R.

Because studies did not always report information for all of our moderators of interest to combine them in a single model (nor did sample size allow for this—see below), we first conducted random-effects models (unmoderated models) using a subset of responses (e.g., a subset of abundance effect sizes) that maximized the number of effect sizes for testing the influence of the moderator variable in question. Then using this same subset, we conducted a mixed-effects model/meta-regression including the moderator of interest. To further account for multiple study comparisons within a study site and species outcomes being reported from the same site, Site ID was included as a random variable in each model. We restricted the number of fitted parameters (<i>j</i>) in any model such that the ratio <i>k/j</i>, where <i>k is</i> the number of effect sizes, was greater than 5, which is sufficient in principle to ensure reasonable model stability and sufficient precision of coefficients [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Vittinghoff E, Glidden DV, Shiboski SC, McCulloch CE.

The small number of effect sizes did not permit the construction of models with multiple variables, therefore weighted simple mixed-effects models were used throughout analyses.</p><p>We only performed analyses of categorical moderators where there were sufficient combinable data sets (i.e., &gt; 2 data sets from ≥ 2 independent studies) for each moderator category. Thus, in some cases, we either combined similar categories to increase the sample size (see Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab3">3</a> Intervention Categories and detailed in “<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Sec32">Results</a>” below) or deleted the categories that did not meet the sample size criteria. For example, the intervention category ‘Rock material’ included the addition or alteration of gravel, cobble, or sediment.</p><p>For all data analyses, total heterogeneity, <i>Q</i><sub>T</sub>, was partitioned into heterogeneity explained by the model, <i>Q</i><sub>M</sub>, and heterogeneity not explained by the model, <i>Q</i><sub>E</sub> (i.e. <i>Q</i><sub>T</sub> = <i>Q</i><sub>M</sub> + <i>Q</i><sub>E</sub>). The statistical significance of <i>Q</i><sub>M</sub> and <i>Q</i><sub>E</sub> were tested against a χ<sup>2</sup> distribution.

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec39">Study design</h4><p>Of the 75 studies included in the systematic review, 25 implemented a Before/After (BA) design. Other than one BA study [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 53" title="Zeug SC, Sellheim K, Watry C, Rook B, Hannon J, Zimmerman J, Cox D, Merz J.

A Control/Impact (CI) design was used in 42 of the included studies (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab4">4</a>). These studies were more likely to include true replication, which often took the form of multiple control/impact streams or study sites. A Before/After/Control/Impact (BACI) design was used in 13 of the studies (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab4">4</a>), and included a minimum of 1 year of before and after data and 1 control and 1 impact site. The number of studies listed above exceeds the total number of studies because some studies included more than one project. A number of studies (19) were excluded from this review at full-text screening based on lack of comparator (‘post-treatment’ design). These studies often described a habitat creation or enhancement with monitoring data, but no data from before the intervention or at a control site.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec40">Population</h4><p>Included studies investigated the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement on 40 species from 25 genera and 11 families (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig5">5</a>).

Gravel (e.g., addition of spawning beds) and cobble (e.g., rock piles or artificial reefs) were the most common interventions applied, followed by gravel washing (e.g., pressure washing). Very few studies tested the removal of sediment through the installation of a sediment trap or the addition of sediment. Waterbody creation was used alone as an intervention in 15.0% of cases, including the creation of a bay or an artificial stream. The addition of plant material was less frequently applied as an individual intervention (e.g., brush, logs; 6.5% of cases), as was the addition of human-made structures (e.g., masonry blocks, ceramic tiles; 4.7% of cases), and waterbody modifications (e.g., grading of banks; 2.8% of cases).</p><p>In 27.1% of all cases, an intervention was applied in combination with one or more different interventions (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab5">5</a>). Of those cases, a combination of 2 interventions (e.g., cobble and gravel, log and human-made structure) was used in 17 cases. A combination of 3 interventions was used in 11 cases (e.g., cobble, gravel, and log), and only 1 case described a combination of 4 interventions (e.g., cobble, gravel, human-made structure, and log).

<h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec42">Measured outcomes</h4><p>The vast majority of studies reported a metric of abundance (including abundance, density, CPUE, and biomass; 91 studies) as an outcome, whereas 12 studies reported a survival metric, and 6 studies reported body size metrics (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig7">7</a>). The studies focused mostly on early life-stage outcomes as opposed to spawning adults. Studies reporting egg data (including nests/redds, zygote or developing embryo, and larvae) and age-0 data (including alevin, fry, YOY) were in almost equal proportion (47 and 51 studies, respectively). Spawning adults were reported in 11 studies, all of which reported abundance metrics. Most studies (63) reported outcomes as quantitative data, whereas 12 studies reported a quantitative approximation (e.g., CPUE, population estimates), 5 studies reported semi-quantitative data (e.g., presence before intervention and quantitative values after intervention), and 2 studies reported only qualitative outcomes. Nearly equal numbers of studies did (38 studies) or did not (41 studies) present intermediate time points of data (i.e., more than just one after year). Most often, studies reported data collected 1 or 2 years post-intervention (44 and 55 cases, respectively).

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec43">Quantitative synthesis</h3><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec44">Description of the data</h4><p>Of the 75 studies (from 64 articles) included in the narrative synthesis, 22 studies (from 20 articles) with 53 data sets were included in the quantitative synthesis. We excluded studies for the following reasons: (1) studies were evaluated as having low study validity (43 studies); (2) measures of outcome variability and/or data on sample sizes were not reported or could not be calculated (7 studies); (3) data were averaged across sampling years, not allowing the most recent before and/or after years to be isolated (1 study) (see details of these studies in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>). Additionally, we excluded 2 further studies because of differences in the comparators used which resulted in different interpretation of effect size estimates (i.e., they were not comparable to other effect sizes). For both BA study designs, and CI designs that compared control and impact sites from the same stream (i.e., impact sites were sites within the same stream where the intervention was applied but otherwise, control and impact sites were similar), based on the Hedges’ <i>g</i>, we would expect a positive estimate if the outcome (abundance, survival, or body size) was higher/longer in the created or enhanced spawning habitat areas (or the after intervention time period) than in areas with no intervention (or the before intervention time period). However, for CI designs that compared impact sites that were degraded and to which an intervention was applied with control sites that represented a more natural condition, based on Hedges’ <i>g</i>, we would expect: (1) a positive effect size (i.e., <i>g</i> &gt; 0) if the intervention resulted in a larger improvement than the control (natural condition), or (2) a neutral effect size (i.e., <i>g</i> = 0) if the outcome at the impact sites was similar to the outcome at the control sites. Because comparator types were not comparable across all study designs, and since there were too few effect sizes to subgroup comparator types, we excluded these two studies from further analyses (i.e., [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Benoit J, Legault M.

All 22 studies included in the quantitative synthesis were assessed as having ‘Medium’ study validity.</p><p>Data sets included in the quantitative synthesis were predominantly from North America (Canada, 13; USA, 17), followed by some from Europe (22), and single study from Asia. The majority of data sets were from studies conducted in lotic ecosystems (91% of data sets), including rivers (83%), creeks (4%), and sounds (4%), and a few data sets were from lentic systems (9%), including reservoirs (6%), and lakes (4%). Eighty-three percent of the data sets used a CI study design, whereas 6% and 11% used a BA or BACI design, respectively (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>).</p><p>Among the 53 data sets extracted, 39 data sets in 17 studies reported species (90% of data sets) or group (i.e., species across genera or families; 10% of data sets) abundances (i.e., counts (15), CPUE (15), density (8), and biomass (1), see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>). Six data sets in 6 studies reported species survival, and 8 data sets in 4 studies reported species (88% of data sets) or group (12%) body size outcomes.</p><p>The majority of the data sets implemented a single intervention type (33/53 data sets). Of the data sets that implemented single interventions, most were evaluations of the effectiveness of the creation of a new waterbody (i.e., stream) or extension of an existing waterbody (i.e., bay), and the addition or alteration of rock material (including sediment, gravel, cobble, boulders, and/or gravel washing or substrate raking) (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab6">6</a>).

<p>There were relatively fewer data sets that used a combination of intervention types to create or enhance spawning habitat (22/53 of data sets). The most common combination of intervention types included the addition of plant material (i.e., logs or vegetation) with: (1) physical alteration to the waterbody (i.e., riparian modifications or excavation), and (2) the addition of rock material (i.e., boulders/cobble) (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab6">6</a>; Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>).</p><p>Among the 53 data sets, 26 fish species from 18 genera and 9 families were targeted for spawning habitat restoration (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab7">7</a>).

<p>Data sets reporting outcomes using age-0 (fry to age-0) as the life stage made up the largest portion (68% of data sets), whereas eggs (including nests/redds, eggs and larvae) made up 30% of data sets. Only a single data set collected outcomes using adult spawners (along with redd counts) (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab6">6</a>; Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>).</p><p>Information on the time since habitat creation or enhancement (time between the last intervention and the last outcome measure) was reported in 38/53 of the data sets. Most data sets were short-term evaluations of spawning habitat restoration, with 47% of the available data sets reporting restoration evaluations between 12 and 24 months after the last intervention was implemented, and 18% of data sets reporting evaluations less than 12 months after the most recent restoration measure was applied. We found some data sets reporting longer-term evaluations, with 26% of the available data sets reporting restoration evaluations between 33 and 74 months after the last intervention was implemented, and 8% of data sets reported data more than 74 months after the last intervention was applied (Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM6">6</a>).</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec45">Global meta-analyses</h4><p>The overall mean weighted effect size for abundance was 0.54 (95% CI 0.32, 0.76; k = 39, p &lt; 0.0001; Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig9">9</a>), corresponding to a 60.4% (95% CI 47.51, 73.23) overall increase in substrate spawning fish abundance with spawning habitat creation or enhancement compared to controls. The majority of effect sizes were positive (i.e., <i>g</i> &gt; 0; 31 of 39), with the remaining 20% showing neutral or negative responses (i.e., <i>g</i> ≤ 0) to spawning habitat creation or enhancement; however, most of the individual effect sizes were not statistically significant, having large confidence intervals that overlapped zero (35 out of 39 effect sizes) (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig9">9</a>).

The previous lack of comprehensive reviews on this topic is likely due in part to the nature of fish habitat restoration (e.g., often conducted by grassroots organizations and volunteers) and the fact that many projects lack proper monitoring. However, many other restoration projects are undertaken to fulfil regulatory requirements where monitoring could be mandatory [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Kondolf GM.

For this review, we systematically obtained all available literature on habitat creation or enhancement for substrate-spawning fish, and as a result, have an extensive database that contains studies for several species, habitat types, restoration types, and locations around the world.</p><p>We identified 75 relevant studies, of which only 22 were eligible for quantitative analysis (all medium-validity studies). We acknowledge that our review does not represent the whole knowledge base on the subject. For instance, we excluded many unreplicated studies (i.e., only one treatment and/or one control site) that were ineligible for quantitative analysis, but did contribute to the narrative review. Furthermore, during our screening process, several articles (28; see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig1">1</a>) were excluded from this review completely due to lack of proper comparator (i.e., before or control data). These studies described above could contribute useful information on this topic; however, the use of the systematic review approach to evaluate the existing literature base allowed us to identify to most relevant, and reliable (minimum biased) studies using this rigorous, objective, and transparent methodology.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec49">Effectiveness of interventions</h3><p>Overall, spawning habitat creation or enhancement generally resulted in higher values of some biological metrics (fish abundance and survival) than control areas not receiving any habitat creation or enhancement. Although many of the effects within the individual studies were not statistically significant (i.e., having 95% confidence intervals that overlapped zero), a meaningful pooled effect (e.g., meta-analytically pooled effect) can arise [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Thompson B.

Here again, the purpose of these summary effect sizes was to identify general trends in the evidence base. Although we found little between-estimate heterogeneity in mean fish abundance in response to habitat creation/enhancements—suggesting a fairly consistent response to interventions—interpretation of summary effects should include some consideration for context. In particular, our analyses were limited by a small number of effect size estimates in general, and by a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (i.e., salmonids were 1 of 9 families represented in the abundance meta-analysis but were ~ 40% of data sets). As such, we caution interpretation of summary effects as evidence that any habitat creation or enhancement measure designed for substrate spawning fish will improve a fish response such as abundance. That said, our findings are consistent with several other reviews that showed a positive effect of habitat enhancements or alterations on fish at various life stages [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Roni P, Beechie T, Pess G, Hanson K.

While this metric was found to be closely related to effect size estimates for some fish outcomes in this review (i.e., abundance: r = 0.748, p &lt; 0.0001, k = 39; survival: r = 0.625, p = 0.184, k = 6; body size: r = 0.660, p = 0.075, k = 8), it is unclear, in a broad sense, how closely related this metric is to Hedges’ <i>g</i>. Data within intervention types were often negatively skewed and these distributions were not improved by applying a transformation. Uncertainty estimation using bootstrapping was not appropriate given the small sample sizes, which has the potential to increase uncertainty in estimated weighted-mean percent changes and confidence intervals [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 65" title="Chernick MR.

As such, it would not be appropriate to explicitly use the estimated weighted-mean percent change in intervention effectiveness towards advocating an offset ratio. For example, a comparison between an estimated 90% increase in abundance with the addition of rock material relative to areas with no intervention and a 49% increase in abundance with the addition of logs relative to control sites, should not be used to infer that fewer rocks than logs are required to achieve equivalency. Furthermore, the weighted-mean percent change in intervention effectiveness should not be used as a benchmark indicator for effectiveness consideration (e.g., a 90% increase in abundance must be achieved for rocks to be considered effective and anything less would require additional offsetting). For both metrics (i.e., Hedges’ <i>g</i> and percent change in intervention effectiveness), all we can infer is the direction (an increase, decrease, or no change) and the relative strength of the treatment effect; neither metric can explicitly provide an offsetting value (e.g., 100 m<sup>2</sup> of rock are needed to achieve an increase in age-0 fish density). As such, we base our conclusions on the relative effectiveness of spawning habitat creation or enhancement interventions for substrate-spawning fish using the Hedges’ <i>g</i> effect size estimates, and strictly use the weighted-mean percent change in intervention effectiveness as a coarse, supplemental indicator of the relative magnitude of the treatment effect. Therefore, we can infer from our results that the addition of rocks is more likely to provide a greater benefit to substrate spawning fishes than an offset based on logs, and while the actual size of the offset should be dependent on the impact and ecological context, this knowledge reduces uncertainty in the ultimate outcome, providing greater confidence in its application.</p><p>The effectiveness of spawning habitat creation or enhancement in increasing fish abundance varied among intervention types. The addition or alteration of rock material was effective in increasing the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls (Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig12">12</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig13">13</a>). There was a strong taxonomic bias towards salmonids for this intervention, i.e., 5/6 data sets for abundance were salmonids [Hedges’ <i>g</i> for salmonids alone = 1.13 (95% CI 0.53, 1.73); k = 5; 89.79% percent change in intervention effectiveness (95% CI 72.87, 106.72) vs. Hedges’ <i>g</i> for all rock data sets = 1.16 (95% CI 0.59, 1.73); k = 6; 90.23% (95% CI 75.02, 105.43)], and studies only focused on egg or larvae life stages (i.e., no studies focused on adult fish) (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab6">6</a>). This result is not surprising given the presumed benefits of new or clean gravel for the creation of redds for salmonids (i.e., easier excavation, less fine sediment; [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 67" title="Kondolf GM.

However, the data set limits our ability to draw conclusions on other substrate-spawning fish. Furthermore, we could not quantitatively investigate the relative effectiveness of different forms of rock material (e.g., cobble vs. gravel sized rock material) due to small sample sizes within these finer scale categories.</p><p>The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris, planting of macrophytes) with or without physical alterations to the waterbody (i.e., riparian modifications or excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to controls (Figs. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig12">12</a>, <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig13">13</a>). Studies evaluating the effectiveness of adding plant material have targeted centrarchids (i.e., <i>Micropterus dolomieu</i> and <i>M. salmoides</i>; smallmouth and largemouth bass), cottids (i.e., <i>Cottus perplexus</i> and <i>C. rhotheus</i>; reticulate and torrent sculpins), cyprinids (i.e., <i>Abramis brama, Gobio gobio, Leucaspius delinineatus,</i> and <i>Rutilus rutilus</i>; common bream, gudgeon, sunbleak, common roach), percids (i.e., <i>Gymnocephalus cernua</i> and <i>Perca fluviatilis</i>; Eurasian ruffe and European perch), and petromyzontids (i.e., <i>Entosphenus tridentatus</i> and <i>Lampetra</i> spp.; lamprey) species; however, they have not targeted salmonids. Plant material (i.e., wood) has been well studied in the context of salmonids but in terms of providing rearing/growth/refuge habitat for juveniles and adults (see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 32" title="Whiteway SL, Biron PM, Zimmermann A, Venter O, Grant JW.

Studies evaluating the effectiveness of combining additions of rock and plant material targeted salmonids, cottids, and cyprinids and presented data from only age-0 fish, which may explain the differences in the magnitude of intervention effectiveness observed for these interventions when implemented alone versus in combination (i.e., targeting different species/life stages). Interestingly, this observation does not appear to be due to differences in the types of plant material used when applied alone or in combination, as logs were added in all cases. However, the intent behind different forms of restoration (e.g., rock and plant material) was not always reported in papers so it may be the case that different materials were used for different purposes (e.g., plant material was used to stabilize a shoreline and reduce erosion while rock was added to provide actual spawning habitat).</p><p>In situations where different intervention types are used in combination to enhance or create habitat, it was not possible to analyze the relative effectiveness of the individual intervention types (e.g., effect of only rock materials when combined with plant materials). In the case of artificial streams, for example, there were often several interventions performed simultaneously to create the new waterbody (i.e., excavation, addition of gravel, planting of macrophytes). Though we recognize that all components may play significant roles in the success or failure of the restoration, in such situations we were unable to isolate the effects of the individual interventions within the study and had to therefore treat them as a single intervention category.</p><p>Biotic responses to particular restoration techniques are highly context-dependent. For instance, physical spawning habitat may be created for salmonids by depositing rocky material, but the quality of such habitat depends on many other factors aside from the composition of the material itself. These include thermal conditions, flow, sedimentation, and dissolved oxygen levels [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Soulsby C, Youngson AF, Moir HJ, Malcolm IA.

Fish may not use created habitats unless all attributes are suitable, and only partly suitable artificial habitats could inadvertently serve as ecological sinks, especially if they fill with sediment after redds are constructed. Unless hatching rates are monitored, the full effectiveness of spawning habitats may be obscured. Even when created habitats are highly suitable, increases in abundance will only occur if fish can access them [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 72" title="Nilsson C, Sarneel JM, Palm D, Gardeström J, Pilotto F, Polvi LE, et al.

Barriers located beyond the restoration site could prevent use and therefore any increase in abundance. Finally, the magnitude of increase in abundance depends on what currently limits population size. If spawning habitat is a limiting factor, then habitat creation projects may be highly successful. However, other exogenous factors such as current population size, prey abundance, and climate can regulate biotic responses to even perfectly constructed and located habitats. In depleted populations for instance, recruitment is limited by the number of available spawners, and the rate of increase in abundance depends on the initial population size [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 73" title="Albanese B, Angermeier PL, Peterson JT.

Habitat restoration or enhancement projects should involve careful consideration of the local context at the planning stage to maximize probability of achieving objectives.</p><p>We were severely limited in our ability to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement measures for particular fish taxa since there have been relatively few studies within and across different restoration measures. For salmonids, the effectiveness of spawning habitat creation or enhancement in increasing salmonid abundance did not differ among intervention types (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Fig12">12</a> and Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#Tab8">8</a>B).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec50">Reasons for heterogeneity</h3><p>As mentioned above, for fish outcomes, there was little variation between effect size estimates, indicating a certain degree of consistency in fish responses to habitat creation or enhancement measures. The reason for this limited heterogeneity in the observed estimates of habitat creation or enhancement effectiveness is somewhat unclear, given the variety of interventions, ecosystem types, and response metrics used. Though we restricted our review to include studies conducted in temperate regions only, there was considerable variation in studied environments. For example, although half of our abundance effect sizes were from studies conducted in North America, these studies spanned a variety of climate zones within both the United States (e.g., Köppen-Geiger climate zones as defined by Peel et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Peel M, Finlayson B, McMahon T.

Therefore, this low level of heterogeneity does not appear to be due to a lack of regional variation among study systems.</p><p>Low heterogeneity across effect size estimates may be explained, at least in part, by a research focus on a relatively small number of fish species. For example, in the quantitative analyses, there were only abundance data for 24 species, from 17 genera and 8 families, of which, a third of all species were from a single family (i.e., Salmonidae). This observation not only highlights a clear taxonomic bias in the current literature base but also a potential consistency in species responses to habitat creation or enhancement projects.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec51">Knowledge gaps and clusters</h3><p>Overall, there were few studies included in the quantitative synthesis that investigated habitat creation or enhancement interventions either alone, or in combination. For example, when combining across all fish taxa for the quantitative synthesis, the greatest number of data sets for any intervention type was 14, involving varying taxa and ecosystem types. This essentially precluded us from drawing any strong conclusions about the effectiveness of measures for fish habitat restoration.</p><p>Small sample size limited our ability to investigate the influence of certain variables that could affect the success of different habitat creation or enhancement measures in a robust manner (e.g., time since the intervention was applied or species-specific factors [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 75" title="Bond NR, Lake PS.

There was often little variation among estimates in the extent to which techniques increased fish abundance within models, suggesting the effectiveness of these techniques was relatively consistent across the studies included in this review (i.e., given the species and interventions for which there were sufficient data).</p><p>The majority of the research we examined focused on a small number of fish species and families. Of all studies included the narrative synthesis, 63.7% reported on the effect of restorations on salmonids and a taxonomic bias towards salmonids can been seen throughout this review.

Further research is needed on a broader range of substrate-spawning fish with a particular focus on those that are at risk or considered a target of restoration activities, both of which can vary significantly by jurisdiction.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec52">Limitations of the review and evidence base</h3><p>Collectively, the studies reviewed here did not provide insight on population-level responses to spawning habitat restoration. For instance, it was unclear whether the amount of existing spawning habitat was a limiting factor, and whether created habitats simply attracted and relocated fish, or increased the overall productive capacity of the ecosystem.

This research at both the reach and watershed scale is required to identify limiting factors, assess population changes, and differentiate attraction from additionality.</p><p>Furthermore, our review focuses only on early life stages (narrative and quantitative syntheses) and adult spawners (narrative synthesis only), which can make it difficult to assess population-level effects of restoration efforts. We excluded outcomes related to juveniles to avoid confounding the effects of spawning habitat enhancements with those of nursery or rearing habitat quality, where factors such as temperature, nutrient availability, food, and cover can dictate success (e.g., the critical-period concept; [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 82" title="Elliott JM.

This decision was made because it becomes increasingly difficult to assess the effects of spawning habitat restoration on success at later life stages, whereas embryonic survival can often be taken as direct evidence of successful restoration [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Fitzsimons JD.

A certain level of ambiguity exists however around cases where authors report on age-0 fishes for evaluations of spawning habitat creation or enhancements. For the purpose of this review, we included all age-0 fish responses based on the assumption that if authors used this age to measure the response, it was likely the most relevant, practical, and/or appropriate age for that species/study. While there are instances when this assumption is likely valid (i.e., where it is known that this age class remains on the spawning substrate for a time period prior to relocation to nursery habitat, or sampling dispersing fish immediately on or downstream of spawning habitat creation/enhancements), there could also be cases where it is not and the age metric is more indicative of nursery habitat use in that the fish could have hatched elsewhere. Although it would have been informative to determine the influence of including all age-0 fish outcomes on the effectiveness of interventions, the evidence base was not large enough to allow us to undertake such a sensitivity analysis (i.e., compare summary effect size with and without the inclusion of age-0 fish responses).</p><p>Due to limitations in the data, we were unable to analyze the long-term effect of habitat restoration or enhancement on substrate-spawning fish. The majority of studies in this review were based on short-term monitoring. Long-term studies are important to identify changes in the effectiveness and longevity of the interventions. For example, gravel beds may wash downstream or fill with silt, only resulting in a positive effect for a year or two. Conversely new or enhanced habitat may increase in value over time as it is naturalized or if it takes time for fish to find and use it. Restoration actions are often coupled with short-term monitoring rather than being the focus of long-term experiments, and resources are often prioritized towards action rather than scientific assessment of effectiveness [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 84" title="Minns CK, Kelso JR, Randall RG.

To properly assess the effectiveness of offsetting activities, it is recommended that a long-term BACI design with a minimum of three years of before data and blocks of <i>continuous</i> after monitoring be used (e.g., three continuous years of sampling immediately post-treatment, and additional three years of sampling at a later time (e.g.,  four to six years post-treatment), and revisit 10 years post-treatment [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 86" title="Smokorowski KE, Bradford MJ, Clarke KD, Clément M, Gregory RS, and Randall RG. 2015.

Spawning habitat restoration occurs in coastal environments; however, such activities are perhaps less frequently conducted or monitored using an experimental design that met our strict criteria. It is also more common for coastal restoration to focus on improving nearshore habitats for juveniles and thus the outcome metric reported would not have been captured by our search strings as relevant to spawning activity.</p><p>Our review was limited to only English articles. Though there may be valuable articles, particularly grey literature, from other countries that are not published in English, we feel that we have captured what is available and most relevant given the Canadian (or more broadly, North American) context of this review.</p><p>There was limited evidence of publication bias; however, there were some geographical and taxonomic biases in the data included in quantitative synthesis. The majority of studies included in quantitative synthesis were from North America (56.6%) and a large percentage (39.6%) targeted salmonids (78.1% and 63.7%, respectively for studies included in the narrative synthesis). Though we did search for available grey literature through websites, the Advisory Team, evidence call-outs, and social media, few relevant articles were obtained and it is almost certain that additional grey literature exists. Habitat restoration is sometimes performed by groups that do not have the resources to publish their results or perform long-term monitoring (e.g., practitioners focused on implementing restoration). It is possible that many habitat restoration effectiveness monitoring activities go undocumented, or are reported in internal documents that were not accessible to our review team.</p><p>As mentioned previously, several articles were excluded from this review due to lack of a proper comparator. Though these excluded studies provide insight into habitat restoration practices (e.g., what interventions are used for specific species or regions), their assumed successes and/or failures cannot be used to determine effectiveness and therefore cannot contribute to the context of this review. Additionally, 29 studies (from 24 articles) were included in the narrative component of this review, as they were unreplicated and therefore ineligible for quantitative analysis. Poor study design has previously been noted specifically in a Fisheries and Oceans Canada context by Harper and Quigley [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 88" title="Harper DJ, Quigley JT.

Several assessment methods exist for monitoring the success of spawning habitat restoration. Although some may be labour intensive [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Fitzsimons JD.

As a consequence, we recommend that researchers and practitioners ensure that they collect data either from before the intervention, or from a reference area nearby to measure the effect of no intervention and include replication at the level of the intervention whenever possible.</p><p>However, given that many real-world restorations or offsets will be single interventions at one site, at a minimum it is important to sample multiple locations at that intervention to provide a variance allowing for quantitative analysis. This pseudoreplication would need to be acknowledged and accounted for in meta-analyses to ensure such data are not over-weighted relative to a true independently replicated intervention. In our study, 20 of the 53 data sets included in our quantitative analyses were based on partly subsampled or pseudoreplicated data. In these instances, outcome means and variances were not from independent replicates but subsamples such as subplots or at the nest level. Although we made a quantitative adjustment to avoid giving pseudoreplicated data too much weight in analysis (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0162-6#MOESM5">5</a>; but also see [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Bernes C, Macura B, Jonsson BG, Junninen K, Müller J, Sandström J, Lõhmus A, Macdonald E.

It remains important that robust monitoring be conducted at the single intervention level, and for such studies to be published acknowledging the pseudoreplication. In combination, unreplicated studies can ultimately contribute to the knowledge base and improve the sample size for a pooled analysis or adjusted meta-analysis, particularly if interventions are similar among studies, and monitoring protocols are consistent.</p><p>Moreover, several studies included in this review had poor data reporting limiting our ability to use them in quantitative analysis. For example, 17 studies did not report variance of group means or provide the raw data necessary for such calculations. There were also six studies that averaged data across years without providing individual year data which impeded our ability to isolate the last sampling year as outlined in our data extraction strategy. Other common reporting issues included unclear study timelines (i.e., we were unable to accurately determine time since intervention), and unclear sampling and analysis units [i.e., sample sizes were not always reported or they could not be determined from reported statistical results (or lack thereof)]. To better facilitate quantitative syntheses, we recommend that authors provide raw data either directly in the article or an appendix/data archiving site, for each year, species, intervention type, and control and impact site separately. In other words, data should not be combined across years and/or sites and authors should clearly distinguish before, during, and after intervention time periods when applicable.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec53">Implications for policy and research</h3><p>Availability of adequate spawning habitat is critical for the sustainability of some fish populations. Attempts to restore or create this habitat requires planning to ensure resources are being used appropriately and the goals of the project are achieved.

This is of particular importance because habitat creation or enhancement is commonly used as an offsetting technique intended to increase fisheries productivity and counterbalance the effects of human development or activities that cannot be avoided or mitigated. The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addition of gravel, rocks, and boulders, substrate washing) was a consistently effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance.</p><p>Overall, we were limited in our ability to address many of the questions that stakeholders had about the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement, in particular, questions related to species specific responses or the relative effectiveness of finer scale details of intervention types (i.e., is the addition of cobble more effective in increasing fish abundance than the addition of gravel?). We believe this is because of two main issues with the current literature base: (1) low study validity, and (2) limited replication of studies across species and interventions. Before we can provide recommendations with a higher level of certainty on the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement on substrate-spawning fish, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand our focus to include a broader range of species and intervention types. We provide several recommendations aimed at researchers and practitioners and recognize that they are most relevant to jurisdictions with an appropriate governance framework and the scientific, management and regulatory capacity to do so.</p></div></div></section>
