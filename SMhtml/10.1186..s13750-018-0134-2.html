        <title>Absence of evidence for the conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe: a systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Systematic conservation planning is a discipline concerned with the prioritisation of resources for biodiversity conservation and is often used in the design or assessment of terrestrial and marine protected area networks. Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe? A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, including publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported outcomes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background information including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context. Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), R&#233;union Island, and The Nature Conservancy&#8217;s landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes. Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios. Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes, and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes. Adequate reporting of outcomes will in turn enable transparency and accountability between institutions and funding bodies as well as improving the science and practice of conservation planning."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Systematic conservation planning is a discipline concerned with the prioritisation of resources for biodiversity conservation and is often used in the design or assessment of terrestrial and marine protected area networks. Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe? A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, including publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported outcomes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background information including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context. Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), Réunion Island, and The Nature Conservancy’s landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes. Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios. Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes, and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes. Adequate reporting of outcomes will in turn enable transparency and accountability between institutions and funding bodies as well as improving the science and practice of conservation planning."/>

Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe?</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, including publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported outcomes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background information including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), Réunion Island, and The Nature Conservancy’s landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes. Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes, and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes. Adequate reporting of outcomes will in turn enable transparency and accountability between institutions and funding bodies as well as improving the science and practice of conservation planning.</p></div></div></section>

Terminology has changed over time (for political expediency; Pressey, in prep) since the CAR (comprehensiveness, adequacy, representativeness) principles that first drove the discipline. Here, representation refers to the extent to which a set of reserves samples the full biodiversity of a region (combining both the original uses of comprehensiveness and representativeness).

First, and most commonly, objectives are expressed as threshold amounts of natural features relative to a baseline. An example is to cover at least 20% of each vegetation type, with no explicit added benefit for amounts over 20%. Second, objectives can be defined as continuous functions that accrue benefit up to 100% coverage of features.

<p>Prior to commencing each screening stage, inter-reviewer consistency checks were conducted with the reviewers involved at that stage. A subset of the same titles/abstracts/or full-texts were screened by all and results were compared using Cohen’s Kappa (<i>k</i>) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Carletta J.

This exercise was repeated, and inclusion rules clarified, until the desired level of consistency was met (threshold <i>k</i> value of 0.5 at title screening and 0.7 for abstract and full-text screening). These <i>k</i> values exceed recommended guidelines [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="CEE.

After this, screening formally started (the articles used in consistency checks were included again in the overall screening). Articles were randomly divided between the reviewers and were not duplicate screened (except those marked as unsure, and at full-text extraction stage).

Articles were included only when all five criteria were relevant. Where insufficient information was provided to determine if the intervention met our definition of systematic conservation planning, further information was sought before reaching a decision, such as by following up cited references about the original plan. Any articles the reviewer was unsure about were flagged as ‘unsure’ and were discussed with the other reviewers prior to reaching a decision.

The aim was to assess the evidence base rather than produce meta-analyses or detailed syntheses. Despite retrieving over 10,000 articles from traditional academic and grey literature sources, only three studies were found to contain robust evaluations of this extensively applied intervention type and none that reported evaluation of natural capital outcomes.

The authors were not able to provide conclusive evidence that systematic conservation planning influenced land acquisition decisions, but this finding masked the complexity underlying the value of the formal ecoregional assessment processes. While they did find that the land acquisition patterns by TNC were positively correlated with priority areas in all states across the USA, no difference was observed in land acquisition patterns before and after systematic ecoregional assessments were implemented.</p><p>Rather than a before/after analysis, Álvarez-Romero et al.

The plans overlapped spatially and temporally to some degree, and the authors employed both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. The six plans that did not meet our definition of systematic conservation planning are not ideal counterfactuals for the relevant plan given that datasets and experiences from earlier plans often influenced subsequent planning processes. Furthermore, these plans were not explicitly contrasted to the relevant plan in the results, as data were aggregated across all seven plans. Use of a survey methodology facilitated an assessment of how goals, outcomes and spatial areas recommended for protection differed between the seven plans. Surveying people one step removed from the plans in question provides an example of how to limit bias when reporting on planning outcomes.</p><p>The third included study by Lagabrielle et al.

We included it because the authors considered the “researcher’s posture in the participatory modelling process” [45:1425] and therefore attempted to recognise potential biases. They provided thoughtful reflections on the scientists’ role in the process, and comparisons between the experience of conducting a systematic conservation planning study using Marxan, with a process where stakeholders co-created models and planning outputs with scientists.</p><p>Another article we screened, by Carter et al.

The authors quantified land management actions (i.e., changes in the amount, location and land cover type of protected areas) in relation to individual state land management plans in Wisconsin, USA. They found that land protection activity increased in prioritized regions after plans were released, an effect that was high for local land protection projects but weak for broader, state-wide plans (a finding consistent with that of Fisher and Dills [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Fisher JRB, Dills B.

Spatial conservation prioritisations made up the majority of the 186 studies we marked as “intervention is similar to, but not systematic conservation planning”.

Additional studies are urgently needed to understand the work of governments and environmental NGOs applying these methods around the globe. A strong assumption from theory is that systematic conservation planning is more effective at conserving species and habitats than alternative approaches to allocating resources for conservation (be they ad hoc, driven by extractive use considerations, or based primarily on stakeholder negotiation). Given the focus on evidence, it is consistent with the epistemology of the discipline to ask whether there is evidence for effectiveness, and to suggest ways in which such evidence might be made more easily available.

To improve evaluation documentation, we suggest including: (a) theories of change about how specific aspects of the planning process were expected to lead to particular outcomes (and where possible, whether results led to a modified understanding of the theory of change); (b) clear descriptions of the study design (with reference to existing classifications e.g. experimental or qualitative sampling [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 82" title="Margoluis R, Stem C, Salafsky N, Brown M.

As a minimum, authors should identify potential alternative explanations (external to the planning process) for observed outcomes and explain their understanding of the relative importance of different potential causal processes. Examples include stakeholder perceptions of the relative importance of a local election in promoting political action, or a natural disaster having reduced interest in planning versus on-ground action. For more see McIntosh et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="McIntosh EJ, Pressey RL, Lloyd S, Smith RJ, Grenyer R.

Future research may consider exploring the evidence for the effectiveness of specific aspects rather than evaluating systematic conservation planning in its entirety (e.g., stakeholder attitudes of consultation processes).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30">Overall conclusion</h3><p>Remarkably few rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans have been conducted to date, despite many claims about their effectiveness. This does not imply systematic conservation planning is, or is not, effective, but highlights the gap in our understanding of how, when and why it may or may not be effective. It also raises important questions about the challenges of conducting rigorous evaluations in relation to a non-linear and multi-dimensional intervention such as conservation planning. We have provided some suggestions as to how these challenges can be overcome. We recommend more focus is required in this area. We urge academics and practitioners alike to publish the results of systematic conservation planning exercises and to employ robust evaluation methodologies when reporting project outcomes.</p></div></div></section>
