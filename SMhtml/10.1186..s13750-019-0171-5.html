        <title>What is the available evidence for the range of applications of genome-editing as a new tool for plant trait modification and the potential occurrence of associated off-target effects: a systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Within the last decades, genome-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas, TALENs, Zinc-Finger Nucleases, Meganucleases, Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis and base editing have been developed enabling a precise modification of DNA sequences. Such techniques provide options for simple, time-saving and cost-effective applications compared to other breeding techniques and hence genome editing has already been promoted for a wide range of plant species. Although the application of genome-editing induces less unintended modifications (off-targets) in the genome compared to classical mutagenesis techniques, off-target effects are a prominent point of criticism as they are supposed to cause unintended effects, e.g. genomic instability or cell death. To address these aspects, this map aims to answer the following question: What is the available evidence for the range of applications of genome-editing as a new tool for plant trait modification and the potential occurrence of associated off-target effects? This primary question will be considered by two secondary questions: One aims to overview the market-oriented traits being modified by genome-editing in plants and the other explores the occurrence of off-target effects. A literature search in nine bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, and 47 web pages of companies and governmental agencies was conducted using predefined and tested search strings in English language. Articles were screened on title/abstract and full text level for relevance based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. The relevant information of included studies were mapped using a pre-defined data extraction strategy. Besides a descriptive summary of the relevant literature, a spreadsheet containing all extracted data is provided. Altogether, 555 relevant articles from journals, company web pages and web pages of governmental agencies were identified containing 1328 studies/applications of genome-editing in model plants and agricultural crops in the period January 1996 to May 2018. Most of the studies were conducted in China followed by the USA. Genome-editing was already applied in 68 different plants. Although most of the studies were basic research, 99 different market-oriented applications were identified in 28 different crops leading to plants with improved food and feed quality, agronomic value like growth characteristics or increased yield, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, herbicide tolerance or industrial benefits. 252 studies explored off-target effects. Most of the studies were conducted using CRISPR/Cas. Several studies firstly investigated whether sites in the genome show similarity to the target sequence and secondly analyzed these potential off-target sites by sequencing. In around 3% of the analyzed potential off-target sites, unintended mutations were detected. Only a few studies conducted off-target analyses using unbiased detection methods (e.g. whole genome sequencing). No off-target effects that could be correlated to the genome-editing process were identified in these studies. The rapid adoption in plant breeding was demonstrated by a considerable number of market oriented applications (crops and traits) described in publications worldwide. Studies investigating off-target effects are very heterogeneous in their structure and design. Therefore, an in-depth assessment regarding their weight of evidence is mandatory."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="What is the available evidence for the range of applications of genome-editing as a new tool for plant trait modification and the potential occurrence of associated off-target effects: a systematic map"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="Within the last decades, genome-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas, TALENs, Zinc-Finger Nucleases, Meganucleases, Oligonucleotide-Directed Mutagenesis and base editing have been developed enabling a precise modification of DNA sequences. Such techniques provide options for simple, time-saving and cost-effective applications compared to other breeding techniques and hence genome editing has already been promoted for a wide range of plant species. Although the application of genome-editing induces less unintended modifications (off-targets) in the genome compared to classical mutagenesis techniques, off-target effects are a prominent point of criticism as they are supposed to cause unintended effects, e.g. genomic instability or cell death. To address these aspects, this map aims to answer the following question: What is the available evidence for the range of applications of genome-editing as a new tool for plant trait modification and the potential occurrence of associated off-target effects? This primary question will be considered by two secondary questions: One aims to overview the market-oriented traits being modified by genome-editing in plants and the other explores the occurrence of off-target effects. A literature search in nine bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, and 47 web pages of companies and governmental agencies was conducted using predefined and tested search strings in English language. Articles were screened on title/abstract and full text level for relevance based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. The relevant information of included studies were mapped using a pre-defined data extraction strategy. Besides a descriptive summary of the relevant literature, a spreadsheet containing all extracted data is provided. Altogether, 555 relevant articles from journals, company web pages and web pages of governmental agencies were identified containing 1328 studies/applications of genome-editing in model plants and agricultural crops in the period January 1996 to May 2018. Most of the studies were conducted in China followed by the USA. Genome-editing was already applied in 68 different plants. Although most of the studies were basic research, 99 different market-oriented applications were identified in 28 different crops leading to plants with improved food and feed quality, agronomic value like growth characteristics or increased yield, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, herbicide tolerance or industrial benefits. 252 studies explored off-target effects. Most of the studies were conducted using CRISPR/Cas. Several studies firstly investigated whether sites in the genome show similarity to the target sequence and secondly analyzed these potential off-target sites by sequencing. In around 3% of the analyzed potential off-target sites, unintended mutations were detected. Only a few studies conducted off-target analyses using unbiased detection methods (e.g. whole genome sequencing). No off-target effects that could be correlated to the genome-editing process were identified in these studies. The rapid adoption in plant breeding was demonstrated by a considerable number of market oriented applications (crops and traits) described in publications worldwide. Studies investigating off-target effects are very heterogeneous in their structure and design. Therefore, an in-depth assessment regarding their weight of evidence is mandatory."/>

Such techniques provide options for simple, time-saving and cost-effective applications compared to other breeding techniques and hence genome editing has already been promoted for a wide range of plant species. Although the application of genome-editing induces less unintended modifications (off-targets) in the genome compared to classical mutagenesis techniques, off-target effects are a prominent point of criticism as they are supposed to cause unintended effects, e.g. genomic instability or cell death. To address these aspects, this map aims to answer the following question: What is the available evidence for the range of applications of genome-editing as a new tool for plant trait modification and the potential occurrence of associated off-target effects? This primary question will be considered by two secondary questions: One aims to overview the market-oriented traits being modified by genome-editing in plants and the other explores the occurrence of off-target effects.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>A literature search in nine bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, and 47 web pages of companies and governmental agencies was conducted using predefined and tested search strings in English language. Articles were screened on title/abstract and full text level for relevance based on pre-defined inclusion criteria. The relevant information of included studies were mapped using a pre-defined data extraction strategy. Besides a descriptive summary of the relevant literature, a spreadsheet containing all extracted data is provided.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Altogether, 555 relevant articles from journals, company web pages and web pages of governmental agencies were identified containing 1328 studies/applications of genome-editing in model plants and agricultural crops in the period January 1996 to May 2018. Most of the studies were conducted in China followed by the USA. Genome-editing was already applied in 68 different plants. Although most of the studies were basic research, 99 different market-oriented applications were identified in 28 different crops leading to plants with improved food and feed quality, agronomic value like growth characteristics or increased yield, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, herbicide tolerance or industrial benefits. 252 studies explored off-target effects. Most of the studies were conducted using CRISPR/Cas. Several studies firstly investigated whether sites in the genome show similarity to the target sequence and secondly analyzed these potential off-target sites by sequencing. In around 3% of the analyzed potential off-target sites, unintended mutations were detected. Only a few studies conducted off-target analyses using unbiased detection methods (e.g. whole genome sequencing). No off-target effects that could be correlated to the genome-editing process were identified in these studies.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>The rapid adoption in plant breeding was demonstrated by a considerable number of market oriented applications (crops and traits) described in publications worldwide. Studies investigating off-target effects are very heterogeneous in their structure and design. Therefore, an in-depth assessment regarding their weight of evidence is mandatory.</p></div></div></section>

However, in an ever-changing world, new challenges will be encountered within the next decades. Aside the demands of the growing global population and limited fossil resources, climate change is a driver of breeding efforts as it is associated with increased extreme weather events like droughts or floods as well as changing dynamics of pests and diseases. Agriculture needs to ensure and increase the world agricultural production to serve extended demands with limited environmental resources like soil and water [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Ronald P.

In contrast, intensification of agriculture causes considerable impact on nature, as naturally diverse landscapes are replaced by arable land for the cultivation of few plant species.

Additionally, plant breeding is of crucial importance to manage environmental impacts on cultivation systems by providing varieties resistant to plant diseases or pests, tolerant to abiotic stress and more broadly support a “greener production”—in time. This may reduce pesticide use and result in less intense management efforts (e.g. irrigation) [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Xie K, Wu S, Li Z, Zhou Y, Zhang D, Dong Z, et al.

New genetic variation occurs naturally by spontaneous mutations that enable some individual plants in a population to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Nevertheless, their application does not completely or per se exclude the occurrence of off-target effects. Off-target effects caused by genome editing most likely occur in DNA sequences that are similar (not identical) to the targeted one but are located at another site in the genome. Mainly, they occur due to the lack of exclusiveness and/or length of the recognition site [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 10" title="SAM High Level Group of Scientific Advisors.

In contrast to the biased detection methods, unbiased ones are used to identify off-target effects in a completely unrestricted way. Therefore, it requires genome-wide sequencing to identify off-target mutations anywhere in the genome and de novo define off-target sites [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 26" title="Martin F, Sánchez-Hernández S, Gutiérrez-Guerrero A, Pinedo-Gomez J, Benabdellah K.

From January 1996 until May 2018, in total 15,703 records were identified from ten bibliographic databases, Google Scholar, the targeted search on 47 company web pages, the USDA-database “Am I regulated?” and the screening of 107 review articles. After removing duplicates (n = 9521), 6182 articles remained and were screened on title/abstract level. Main reasons for exclusion at this stage were the application of genome-editing in animals and the absence of primary data. 941 articles passed the inclusion criteria on title/abstract level or were rated as “unclear” and remained included for full text screening. The application of the inclusion criteria at full text level resulted in 524 relevant articles. Searching for grey literature on company websites and websites from governmental authorities identified another 31 further relevant documents and web pages that were considered during data extraction.

<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec31">Prediction of potential off-target sites by CRISPR/Cas</h3><p>Different prediction tools can be used to identify potential off-target sites. All of them have in common that based on sequence alignment programs DNA-sequences are identified in which unintended mutations could occur due to high similarity between the targeted sequence and the potential off-target site. However, the prediction of a potential off-target site is not equated with a real off-target mutation. It has to be shown in a follow up step by verifying the potential off-target site using biased detection methods. 205 CRISPR/Cas studies searched for potential off-target sites. As shown in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0171-5#Fig9">9</a>, many different prediction tools were used to identify these sites. Mainly, three tools were used to predict potential off-target sites. BLAST was used 54 times, CRISPR-P 51 times and CasOFF-Finder 31 times. 12 other prediction tools were used in 31 studies (for detailed information see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0171-5#MOESM6">6</a>). 41 studies did not provide any details about the used tool(s).

In this study, a series of mismatches were introduced at the sgRNA followed by analyzing whether the targeted sequence was successfully mutated despite the mismatch(es) between the sgRNA and the targeted sequence. Additionally, in this study, the off-target patterns between two PAMs (NGG and NAG) were compared. 22 times the sgRNA was designed in a way that it contained one mismatch to the targeted sequence. 15 of these altered sgRNA induced a DSB at the targeted sequence. 14 times the sgRNA contained two mismatches to the targeted sequence and four of these sgRNA induced a DSB in the targeted sequence. Moreover, eight times the sgRNA contained three mismatches. In these cases, no mutation was identified in the targeted sequence [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 175" title="Meng X, Hu X, Liu Q, Song X, Gao C, Li J, Wang K.

Hence, the more mismatches are tolerated in prediction the higher is the number of potential off-target sites (in the paper: one, two or three mismatches tolerated: No potential off-target sites, four mismatches tolerated: One potential off-target site, five mismatches tolerated: 60 potential off-target sites, six mismatches tolerated: 515 potential off-target sites, seven mismatches tolerated: 3689 potential off-target sites).

The publication rate of primary research has risen sharply since the CRISPR/Cas technique was first applied in plants in 2013. It is worth mentioning that in total primary studies from 33 countries were identified but nearly three quarter of these studies originate from either China (40%) or the USA (33%). For comparison, Japan and Germany published around 6% of the studies each and no other country contributed more than 2% of the total. Summarizing the number of published studies by continent, more than 50% of the studies were conducted in an Asian country (53%), around one-third in North American countries (34%) and only 13% in European countries. As the genome-editing techniques, especially CRISPR/Cas, were just recently developed, the large majority of the existing applications represent basic research. Nevertheless, almost 100 different applications aimed to produce beneficial agricultural traits in 28 different agricultural crops. We determined that the majority of such “market-oriented” applications have been carried out in economically important crops such as maize, rice, wheat and soybeans, but less economically important crops such as cucumber, lettuce, peanut or grapefruit have been worked on as well. The market-oriented applications address several breeding objectives including yield improvement, improved growth characteristics, improved food and feed quality, tolerances to biotic and abiotic stress, herbicide tolerance and industrial utilization. This indicates that genome-editing is able to address beneficial traits for the agricultural value chain and could contribute to food security and the environmental management. To confirm this hypothesis a systematic review would be required to quantify such effects.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec42">Off-target effects of genome-editing</h3><p>252 studies investigated the occurrence of off-target effects following a genome-editing application in plants. Most of these studies were performed with the genome-editing technique CRISPR/Cas (n = 228), whereas only a few studies used TALENs (n = 9), BE (n = 9), ZFN (n = 4), MN (n = 1) or ODM (n = 1). Reasons for these findings are that the total number of studies in which CRISPR/Cas was applied is much larger compared to the other genome-editing techniques. Additionally, CRISPR/Cas is more susceptible to off-target effects compared to other nuclease techniques such as ZFN and TALENs, as it works as a monomer, whereas ZFN and TALENs work as dimers [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 182" title="Khandagale K, Nadaf A.

In addition, the sgRNA used in CRISPR/Cas-applications is able to tolerate several mismatches leading to the induction of a DSB at a site in the DNA that is similar but not identical to the targeted sequence [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 32" title="Zischewski J, Fischer R, Bortesi L.

In most CRISPR/Cas studies biased detection methods were used, meaning that potential off-target sites were first predicted using bioinformatics programs followed by targeted sequencing of these sites for the occurrence of off-target effects. The biased method suggests a very broad data basis, but as shown in the result section, individual studies are very heterogeneous in their structure and design. Heterogeneity was identified regarding the plant species, the CRISPR-variant, the prediction tools and detection methods used, the amount of tolerated mismatches and the chosen sgRNA. In order to allow any conclusions to be drawn about the occurrence of off-target effects a more in-depth analysis e.g. by a systematic review is mandatory.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec43">Knowledge gaps</h3><p>Regarding secondary question 2, several topics have been identified representing knowledge gaps where no studies or only a small number of studies exist. A knowledge gap exists for the analysis of off-target effects in TALENs, ZFN, MN, ODM and BE. Only nine studies have been identified analyzing the occurrence of off-target effects in TALENs and BE studies. The amount of off-target studies for ZFN (n = 4), ODM (n = 1) and MN (n = 1) were even lower. For a more in-depth off-target analysis regarding these techniques, further research and more primary studies are needed. However, the CRISPR/Cas technique is applied much more frequently because of efficiency, time saving and cost-effectiveness compared to TALENs, ZFN, ODM and MN [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 182" title="Khandagale K, Nadaf A. Genome editing for targeted improvement of plants. Plant Biotechnol Rep. 2016;10:327–43. &#xA;https://doi.org/10.1007/s11816-016-0417-4&#xA;&#xA;." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0171-5#ref-CR182" id="ref-link-section-d69214e4634">182</a>]. Therefore, it is questionable what additional research effort is justified. BE differs as it has great potential to support plant breeding, though it is not broadly established yet. It is based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system but enables exchanging individual base pairs at specific sites without inducing a DSB. Our map shows that only a few BE studies addressed the occurrence of off-target effects so far. The likely reason is that BE is a “young” method in plants, and its first publication was in 2017. Further research about BE including the analysis of off-target effects is highly recommended. Another knowledge gap affecting all genome-editing techniques is the genome-wide analysis of off-target effects in a completely unrestricted way. Only nine studies addressed this aspect using the CRISPR/Cas technique and one using the TALENs technique. No study analyzed off-target effects using unbiased detection methods in ZFN, ODM, MN and BE studies.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec44">Knowledge clusters</h3><p>The analysis of off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas studies using biased detection methods represents a knowledge cluster. This cluster is amenable for a critical appraisal serving the interest of researchers and decision-makers. The following parameters could affect the occurrence of off-targets and are worth to be analyzed in-depth:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Genome composition, size and ploidy level of different plant species.</p></li><li><p>Amount of tolerated mismatches at the potential off-target sites.</p></li><li><p>Quality of available biased detection methods.</p></li><li><p>CRISPR variants (e.g. Nickase).</p></li><li><p>Chosen sgRNA.</p></li><li><p>Methodology of SDN delivery.</p></li></ul>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec45">Limitations of the systematic map</h3><p>References were only searched in German and English language. Publications in an Asian language, in which only the abstract was available in English, were also identified but could not be included in this map for the extraction of detailed data. Since most of the studies were found in scientific journals, a bias in the pool of articles found is that publications from countries that probably use genome editing but do not publish in either English or German language are not represented. For example, it can be assumed that in South American countries, considerably more research is done than the identified literature suggests. Identifying grey literature as well as manually identifying scientific journals publishing in the local language(s) was also not possible due to language barriers.</p><p>Additionally, the full text of 104 articles, that have been rated as relevant on title/abstract level, were un-retrievable and were therefore not included in the systematic map (see Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-019-0171-5#MOESM3">3</a>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the individual studies addressing off-target effects differ widely in design and implementation. Therefore, no reliable conclusions about the occurrence of off-target effects can be drawn based on the results of this map. A critical appraisal of the individual studies in form of a systematic review is recommended.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec46"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec46-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec46">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec46-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec47">Implications for policy/management</h3><p>This systematic map identified substantial bodies of evidence regarding the applications of different genome-editing techniques in plants as well as the occurrence of off-target effects. Until May 2018, almost 100 market-oriented applications were identified including improved food and feed quality, yield improvement, altered growth characteristics, resistance against biotic and abiotic stress, herbicide tolerance and industrial utilization. The wide range of different applications addressing all parts in the agricultural value chain and the application in many different plant species indicates that genome-editing became a promising tool to breed varieties that are better adapted to the needs of agriculture and to enable a valuable contribution to food security and the environment.</p><p>A decisive factor that impacts the use of genome-editing is the acceptance by consumers and retailers for products derived from innovative plant breeding methods. A prominent point of criticism in this context is the occurrence of off-target effects. Since plant breeding is the contextual background, it is worth to compare the occurrence of off-target effects in the context of naturally occurring mutations and routinely used breeding techniques like regular crossing or undirected mutagenesis using chemical mutagens or irradiation [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 10" title="SAM High Level Group of Scientific Advisors.

A critical appraisal in the course of a systematic review could help to identify parameters in order to further reduce the occurrence of off-target effects. The identified knowledge cluster for the detection of off-target effects in CRISPR-studies using biased detection methods would be suitable to address this.</p><p>The results of this map further identified a knowledge gap regarding the analysis of off-target effects using unbiased detection tools. To increase this data basis and to evaluate whether an unbiased off-target analysis has an added value compared to biased of target analysis, more studies should assess this aspect, in future.</p></div></div></section>
