        <title>How are biodiversity and dispersal of species affected by the management of roadsides? A systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity. This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website. Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively. This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research."/>

        <meta property="og:title" content="How are biodiversity and dispersal of species affected by the management of roadsides? A systematic map"/>
        <meta property="og:description" content="In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity. This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website. Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively. This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research."/>

Hence, there are similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>This systematic map provides an overview of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5 literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS application that can be accessed at an external website.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207 articles included after screening described 301 individual studies considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe. More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3% of the studies, respectively.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research.</p></div></div></section>

Moreover, roadsides can serve as nesting sites for many insects, especially if they are sandy and exposed to the sun.

In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly mown for traffic-safety reasons, and their vegetation will then remain at the same successional stage year after year. Hence, there are similarities in management and abiotic conditions between roadsides and habitats such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed semi-natural grasslands [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 28" title="Rydgren K, Nordbakken J-F, Austad I, Auestad I, Heegaard E.

In contrast, due to their low productivity, roadsides on dry and nutrient-poor soils may need little management to meet traffic-safety requirements.</p><p>In Sweden, roadside management is currently being discussed as an important part of overall landscape management for biodiversity. The Swedish Board of Agriculture recently estimated that 190,000 hectares of managed grasslands occur along built infrastructure in Sweden, 164,000 ha of which constitute roadsides [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Stenmark M.

However, the narrow linear nature of verges, the use of road salt for de-icing, ditching and reinforcement activities, sowing of exotic plant material and other measures specific to infrastructure maintenance are likely to impact species and communities differently to traditional management of open grasslands. Moreover, much of the existing evidence on ecological effects of roadside management comprises grey literature not assessed by external reviewers. For these reasons, key stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadsides.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec4">Topic identification, scientific basis and stakeholder input</h3><p>The topic of the proposed systematic map was suggested by the Swedish Board of Agriculture at a meeting with stakeholders arranged by the Mistra Council for Evidence-Based Environmental Management (EviEM) in 2013.

For that reason, articles found by searches in literature databases were first evaluated for inclusion based on titles and abstracts combined. This assessment was made by a single reviewer (SJ), who in cases of uncertainty tended towards inclusion. At an early stage of the screening, a subset consisting of 100 of the articles was also assessed by a second reviewer (CB). The consistency of the two reviewers’ assessments of these articles was checked with a kappa test. Since the outcome, κ = 0.675, indicated a ‘substantial’ agreement [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 43" title="Landis JR, Koch GG. The measurement of observer agreement for categorical data.

This task was shared by all members of the review team. The articles were randomly distributed within the team, but some redistribution was made to avoid having reviewers assess studies authored by themselves or articles written in an unfamiliar language. In cases of uncertainty, the reviewers chose inclusion rather than exclusion, but an article that was regarded as highly questionable though not obviously irrelevant could also be categorised as ‘doubtful’. All articles that the main reviewer categorised as either doubtful or worthy of inclusion were also assessed by one or two other reviewers. Any disagreements were reconciled case by case, largely based on decisions taken by the review team as a whole on how to deal with various kinds of borderline topics.</p><p>Articles found using search engines, specialist websites or literature reviews were entered at the second stage of this screening process. A list of articles rejected on the basis of full-text assessment is provided in Additional file <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1#MOESM2">2</a> together with the reasons for exclusion. This file also contains a list of articles that we assessed as potentially relevant based on title and abstract but were unable to find in full text.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small c-article__sub-heading--light" id="Sec16">Study inclusion criteria</h4><p>Each study had to pass each of the following criteria in order to be included:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Relevant subjects: Roadsides. A roadside was defined as the unpaved zone along a road that is exposed to roadside management. On small, unpaved roads, studies of the road itself could also be included.</p><p>While stakeholders suggested that the review include studies of roadside management in temperate, boreal and subalpine zones (and high-altitude areas in subtropical and tropical zones), we found little reason to impose any geographical restriction at all, since many basic ecological mechanisms will be the same everywhere. Therefore, we included relevant studies from anywhere in the world.</p></li><li><p>Relevant types of intervention: Roadside management, including but not restricted to mowing, removal of shrubs and saplings, pruning, coppicing, control of invasive/nuisance species, herbicide use, sowing or planting, burning, grazing by livestock, tillage and other forms of soil cultivation, mulching, topsoiling, use of erosion-control mats or blankets, fertiliser addition, liming, irrigation, ditching and maintenance of ditches. Such measures were also considered as relevant where they had been applied during construction of new roadsides.</p></li><li><p>Relevant type of comparator: Non-intervention or alternative forms of roadside management.</p><p>Comparisons can in principle be made both temporally and spatially. Studies with a ‘BA’ (Before/After) design compare data collected at the same site prior to and following an intervention. Other studies may be based on comparison of different areas along a roadside, some that have been subject to a certain kind of management and some that have not. These may be termed as ‘CI’ (Comparator/Intervention) studies, or ‘BACI’ (Before/After/Comparator/Intervention) if they present data collected both before and after the intervention. Studies of interventions made at different distances from a road were not included in the review when effects of roadside management were confounded with distance from the road.</p></li><li><p>Relevant types of outcome: (a) Measures of local or regional biodiversity, e.g. alpha/beta/gamma species diversity, genetic diversity, abundance of individual species, and abundance of functional/taxonomic groups of organisms (including measures of the total abundance of vegetation). (b) Measures of species dispersal along roads or roadsides, e.g. species distribution patterns or movement rates of individuals or propagules.</p><p>All species and groups of animals, plants, fungi and bacteria were considered to be relevant. We also included studies where none of the types of outcome listed above were explicitly reported, but where it was likely (based on other results or on the methods description) that data relevant to our review had actually been sampled and might be available courtesy of the study authors. Such studies were only included if published in 2006 or later, however. Ratings of intervention effects based on visual assessments of vegetation vitality were not considered to be relevant.</p></li><li><p>Relevant type of study: Primary field studies.</p></li><li><p>Language: Full text written in English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish or Swedish.</p></li></ul>
<h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17">Study quality assessment</h3><p>No formal quality appraisal was made of studies subsequent to their inclusion in the review, since this is not considered necessary for the purposes of a systematic map [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Collaboration for Environmental Evidence.

<p>Searches using search engines returned 89 potentially relevant articles (8 found with English search terms, 3 with Danish, 5 with Dutch, 1 with French, 0 with German, 2 with Norwegian, 31 with Spanish and 39 with Swedish ones) in addition to those that had already been identified.</p><p>Similarly, searches at specialist websites located another 38 potentially useful publications (22 found using English search terms, 0 with Danish, 5 with Dutch, 1 with Norwegian and 10 with Swedish ones). One additional article that we had not identified ourselves was found in one of the literature reviews that we checked after having concluded our online searches.</p><p>In all, the searches resulted in 2834 articles considered promising enough to be assessed in full text. The majority of these articles had been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, but about one-third (33%) consisted of reports from e.g. agencies or consultants, conference proceedings, theses, policy documents, newsletters or other kinds of grey literature. Most of the latter category of articles were identified when we searched in transport research international documentation (TRID), a large online bibliographic database of transportation research. Here, our search string returned 1530 articles not found in any of the other twelve publication databases that we used. Based on titles and abstracts, we categorised 627 of these articles as potentially relevant. Of them, we were able to retrieve only 231 (37%) in full text.

<p>The majority of the 207 articles included in the systematic map (197, or 95%) were written in English. The remaining articles were written in one of several languages: Dutch (3), Swedish (3), Danish (2) or Norwegian (2).</p><p>Almost 60% of the included articles (120) had been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Nearly all of these articles (112) had been identified through our searches in Web of Science, Scopus and similar ‘general-purpose’ publication databases that cover broad ranges of scientific literature. The remaining 87 articles that we included can be characterised as grey literature. About three quarters of them (65) were found in TRID, and the majority (68) consist of reports issued or commissioned by state departments of transportation in the United States and/or by federal US agencies. The grey publications also include 7 reports from agencies or research institutes outside the US, 6 Bachelor’s, Master’s or Ph.D. Theses, and 6 papers in conference proceedings.</p><p>Both the journal articles and the grey literature included in this systematic map cover a period that began in the early 1960s and extended to 2014 or 2015.

<p>The dominance of US studies was mainly due to the large number of grey literature reports from state-level roadside managers. Studies published in scientific journals had a more even geographic distribution, 51 having been performed in the US, 56 in Europe, and 24 elsewhere in the world.</p><p>Information on the types of road where effects of roadside management had been investigated was available for only 40% of the studies, but 61 of them had been carried out along large roads (four-lane highways or heavily used two-lane roads), 60 along less heavily used but paved roads, and 19 along small, unpaved roads. Similarly, information on land use in areas adjacent to the roads was available for less than a third of the included studies, but 48 of them had data on roadsides surrounded by arable land, 36 on roadsides in forested areas, 35 on roadsides surrounded by grass- or scrubland (managed or not), and 17 on roadsides in urban or suburban areas.</p><p>Most of the interventions studied could be characterised as regular maintenance or restoration of roadsides (147 and 134 studies, respectively), whereas 39 studies reported on measures taken when roadsides were established along recently constructed roads.</p><p>The interventions most commonly studied were herbicide use (29% of the studies), sowing (29%) and mowing (28%)—see Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1#Tab2">2</a>. Many studies investigated several different kinds of intervention, individually and/or in combination. Most of the studies published as grey literature focused on herbicide use, biological amendments (e.g. sowing or planting), or soil amendments (e.g. fertiliser addition, liming, topsoiling, mulching, tillage, irrigation or erosion control), whereas studies of non-chemical vegetation disturbance such as mowing, mechanical removal of shrubs/saplings, grazing or burning more often were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1#Fig3">3</a>).</p><div class="c-article-table" data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption class="c-article-table__figcaption"><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Combinations of interventions and organism groups studied (No. of studies)</b></figcaption><div class="u-text-right u-hide-print"><a class="c-article__pill-button" data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1/tables/2"><span>Full size table</span><svg width="16" height="16" class="u-icon"><use xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#global-icon-chevron-right"></use></svg></a></div></figure></div>

<p>The outcomes most frequently investigated were effects of roadside management on herbs/forbs (77% of the studies), graminoids (69%) and woody plants (35%) (Table <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1#Tab2">2</a>).

The outcomes were reported as abundances of single species or groups of species in 83 and 47% of the included studies, respectively, as total abundance of vegetation in 25% of them, and as species richness or some kind of diversity index in 23 and 3% of the studies, respectively. Diversity measures such as species richness were reported considerably more often in studies published in peer-reviewed journals than in studies published as grey literature (42 and 11%, respectively).

This also means that the results of such comparisons could potentially be relevant to roadside managers all over the world. However, the studies we found had a major geographical bias in that the vast majority of them were conducted in North America (71%) or Europe (23%). Only a few studies had been performed in subtropical regions and almost none in the tropics.

Nevertheless, it is clear from the evidence base that the focus of research into such management has shifted over time. Studies of roadside maintenance made in the 1980s and earlier were dominated by efforts to find efficient ways of keeping vegetation in check for traffic safety reasons. More recent research has increasingly dealt with ecological aspects of roadside management, and with conservation or restoration of roadside biodiversity in particular. This development has been reflected by increasing amount of data on species richness in grey literature such as reports commissioned by roadside managers. The change of priorities is probably due at least partly to awareness of the current global decline of grasslands [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 48" title="Egoh B, Bengtsson J, Lindborg R, Bullock J, Dixon A, Rouget M.

Nevertheless, the majority of studies included an experimental set-up designed to test directly for ecological effects of various intervention types and intensities. Many of them investigated more than one management technique. About 20% of all included studies applied a full factorial design to explore the individual and combined effects of two or more different interventions, but few of these studies looked for interactions between the interventions.</p><p>Mowing is the most frequently investigated non-chemical method for managing vegetated roadsides, regardless of the main purpose of this kind of management. Studies of the effects of mowing can e.g. clarify how managers may optimise the function of roadsides as substitutes for meadows, pastures and similar semi-natural grasslands [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="Lindborg R, Plue J, Andersson K, Cousins SAO. Function of small habitat elements for enhancing plant diversity in different agricultural landscapes.

Other management options based on non-chemical disturbance of vegetation include grazing, burning, and mechanical removal of shrubs and saplings. These methods have been studied less extensively than mowing, however. In particular, we found surprisingly few studies that examined effects of roadside grazing (six studies, of which five were made in Australia and one in South Africa, but none in North America or Europe). One likely reason is that grazing is comparatively uncommon along roadsides, since traffic safety may be compromised if livestock are kept close to major roads.</p><p>The application of herbicides or growth retardants along roadsides was introduced in the 1950s and 1960s as an inexpensive alternative to mowing, not least in the US, and much of the early research on this topic explored the ability of various chemicals to control roadside vegetation (or ‘weeds’) in general. Later, however, chemical management of roadsides was increasingly restricted, and several of the more recent studies of herbicide use have investigated the possibilities of substituting conventional chemicals like phenoxyacetic acids with substances considered to be less harmful. Nevertheless, conventional herbicides remain widely used as a means of controlling invasive species, although a recent systematic review has indicated that many large-scale schemes of that kind have been only moderately successful [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 52" title="Kettenring KM, Reinhardt Adams C. Lessons learned from invasive plant control experiments: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

A considerable amount of research is still devoted to clarifying whether different chemical compounds can be used to control specific invasive plants along roadsides.</p><p>Nearly half of the studies included in the systematic map deal with attempts to revegetate roadsides rather than remove vegetation from them. In dry climates especially, the roadsides may remain more or less bare for many years after the construction of a road, unless active measures are taken to reintroduce some kind of vegetation. Re-establishment or restoration of vegetation on roadsides is primarily based on sowing or planting of selected plant species, but it may also include various soil amendments, e.g. fertiliser addition, liming, topsoiling, mulching or soil cultivation. In this case, too, the focus of research has shifted in a way that reflects new priorities in roadside management. Increasingly, studies have explored the possibilities of restoring native vegetation along roadsides using local plant material or seed sources, not least where the current vegetation is dominated by exotic species introduced through earlier revegetation efforts.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Outcomes</h3><p>We found a huge bias towards plants in the taxa considered by studies included in the map. Studies on other taxa, such as invertebrates, hardly looked at management of roadsides. This possibly reflects a focus on vegetation management for road safety, although latter studies have had a more conservation focus. This bias is found in the wider conservation literature (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 53" title="Humbert J-Y, Pellet J, Buri P, Arlettaz R.

This is not surprising as the focus in studies is the roadside. However, if roadside management is to be designed to benefit biodiversity widely, then such impacts need to be studied. Some of the studies that we found report data not only from roadsides but also from meadows, pastures or similar semi-natural grasslands, but few of these studies were designed to investigate similarities or differences between roadside and non-roadside habitats. This limits their capacity of clarifying to what extent roadsides can act as refuges for species threatened by the current decline of semi-natural grasslands.</p><p>At least as importantly, we found no relevant studies of the effects of roadside management on species’ dispersal.

Livestock grazing and movement are often invoked as enhancing grassland connectivity through their dispersal of seeds, but grazing on roadsides is uncommon, as we found in this systematic map.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec25">Limitations of the systematic map</h3><p>This systematic map is limited to the studies we were able to find using search terms, databases and languages established in our protocol. Despite our ambition to be inclusive, we have undoubtedly missed some important studies. For instance, 53 papers identified as potentially relevant based on their English abstracts were subsequently excluded because they were not written in any of the eight languages that we master.</p><p>Besides searching for articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals, we went to considerable effort to identify, retrieve and assess studies published in the grey literature. The latter efforts were only partly successful—many reports that we judged as potentially relevant based on titles and abstracts turned out to be unavailable in full text online. The grey literature for which we could source the full text was greatly dominated by studies conducted in the US. We obtained relatively few useful reports from other parts of the world, although we searched the websites of more than 40 national and international organisations and publication databases using search terms in eight different languages. Nevertheless, more than half of the studies that we included in the map were published in various kinds of grey literature.</p><p>Many of the studies found in the grey literature were several decades old, and some of them provide little information about methodology and interventions. Still, they constitute a very substantial portion of the available evidence on biodiversity effects of roadside management. It may be important to consider them not least since this can reduce the impact of publication bias—positive (statistically significant) results tend to be overrepresented in peer-reviewed scientific literature but less so in grey literature [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 39" title="Collaboration for Environmental Evidence.

The grey literature that we identified includes several extensive and well-documented studies with a wealth of data on how different kinds of management have affected the biodiversity of roadsides (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 57" title="Anon.

Like any findings, however, those published in grey literature have to be used and interpreted with some care.

As such it should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and policymakers. It is challenging for practitioners to read and synthesise the evidence on individual interventions, but the map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from published research. Next to aiding the management of established roadsides, the map can also be used as a source of inspiration for the design of new roadsides, e.g. by providing an overview of the range of interventions that can be applied.</p><p>The map includes more than a hundred studies of non-chemical interventions that may aid the conservation or restoration of biodiversity in roadsides, including their role as substitutes for grasslands and other habitats under threat in intensively managed landscapes. More specifically, we identified 98 studies of how the richness or abundance of species in roadsides is affected by vegetation disturbance by managers, such as regular mowing, burning, grazing or selective mechanical removal of plants. Since all of these interventions entail removal of plant biomass they are comparable, and a review of their impact on biodiversity should permit some generalisable conclusions. Most of the studies have recorded management effects on vascular plants, but there are also 14 potentially relevant investigations of insects or other invertebrates. These studies should be of considerable interest to roadside managers, including e.g. transportation and conservation agencies, park authorities, municipalities, and farmers and other private landowners. This has been confirmed by our contacts with Swedish stakeholders.</p><p>It should be noted, though, that the mapping exercise has made clear to us that biodiversity of roadsides is generally still regarded as a side-product of regular road-safety management rather than a goal in its own right. This is reflected by the poor articulation of biodiversity-related management goals in the reviewed studies. Considering roadside management as part of a wider landscape management and thoroughly analysing the functions and services that can be delivered by roadsides will help to design more diversified and context-specific management strategies that take into account multiple functions and the trade-offs and synergies between them. The growing interest of biomass production in roadsides (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Van Meerbeek K. Low-input high-diversity systems: Potential for biomass and bioenergy production. Leuven: KU Leuven, Belgium; 2015." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0103-1#ref-CR59" id="ref-link-section-d47059e2659">59</a>]) can serve as an example in this respect. Feedstocks for bioenergy production are highly searched for, and roadsides could represent a considerable extra source given their large extent. Such multifunctional roadside use, with a potential to create win–win-wins for safety, biodiversity conservation and bioeconomy, could be considered when designing future roadside management plans.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec28">Implications for research</h3><p>By identifying areas where a substantive body of scientific knowledge has been accumulated, this systematic map provides a foundation for full systematic reviews on specific subtopics. Such reviews would provide a synthesis of available evidence, making the information more accessible and easily applicable by managers and policymakers.</p><p>However, although a substantial body of research exists, the map highlights important knowledge gaps: little data was found on some geographical regions (notably the tropics and subtropics), research is taxonomically heavily biased towards plants, and not a single study was found on how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could therefore be a source of inspiration for new research. Important potential topics include the effects of management on patterns of multidiversity and multifunctionality in roadsides, and the relationship between them. Besides, the importance of roadsides for biodiversity at the landscape scale is still heavily understudied, as is the role of roadsides for species dispersal. Finally, care has to be taken that biodiversity (and other) targets are clearly articulated when designing and publishing future research on roadside management.</p><p>We will now proceed with a full systematic review of how maintenance or restoration of roadsides based on non-chemical vegetation removal affects the diversity of vascular plants and invertebrates [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 60" title="Bernes C, Bullock JB, Jakobsson S, Verheyen K, Lindborg R.
