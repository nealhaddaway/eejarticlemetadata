        <title>Evidence for changes in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts resulting from exposure to alien species in Europe: a systematic map | Environmental Evidence | Full Text</title>

        

    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Alien species are frequently considered a serious environmental threat but negative impacts on human health through injury, allergy, or as vectors of disease sometimes have the most dire consequences for human livelihoods. Climate change and the increasing magnitude and frequency of introductions of species across geographic barriers as a result of international trade are likely to change their establishment, spread, abundance, physiology or phenology, potentially also altering their human health impacts. Yet despite receiving increasing attention in the scientific literature, there have been few attempts to quantify recent changes in human health impacts. Here we report the findings from a systematic map of the literature identifying evidence of any change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of impacts of alien species on human health in Europe over the last 25&#160;years. We conducted a systematic search of the ecological and medical literature using English language search terms to identify potentially relevant studies. Search results were assessed against inclusion criteria published in an a priori protocol at title, abstract and full-text to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Repeatability was checked at each stage by comparing a subset between reviewers and testing for inter-rater agreement using Cohen&#8217;s kappa test. Studies deemed relevant at full text were coded against bibliographic, inclusion and study design criteria to create a searchable database of evidence. Searches retrieved over 15,700 results yet only sixteen cases met criteria for inclusion in the systematic map. Most of this evidence represents first records of impacts from different areas, and in particular first reports of transmission of exotic diseases by introduced mosquito species. There is currently limited published evidence demonstrating a change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts caused by alien species in Europe over the last 25&#160;years. Relevant studies relate to only a few species, often report specific cases and rarely link health impacts with ecology, distribution or spread of the species. Difficulties in attributing human health impacts, such as stings or allergies, to a specific alien species likely complicate attempts to measure changes, as may differences in professional interests between the environmental and health professions. Future studies could helpfully compare spread or abundance with reported, rather than potential, health impacts. Better cooperation between invasion ecologists and health professionals working in affected areas are likely to be necessary to improve the evidence base on this topic for the future."/>

        <meta property="og:description" content="Alien species are frequently considered a serious environmental threat but negative impacts on human health through injury, allergy, or as vectors of disease sometimes have the most dire consequences for human livelihoods. Climate change and the increasing magnitude and frequency of introductions of species across geographic barriers as a result of international trade are likely to change their establishment, spread, abundance, physiology or phenology, potentially also altering their human health impacts. Yet despite receiving increasing attention in the scientific literature, there have been few attempts to quantify recent changes in human health impacts. Here we report the findings from a systematic map of the literature identifying evidence of any change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of impacts of alien species on human health in Europe over the last 25&amp;nbsp;years. We conducted a systematic search of the ecological and medical literature using English language search terms to identify potentially relevant studies. Search results were assessed against inclusion criteria published in an a priori protocol at title, abstract and full-text to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Repeatability was checked at each stage by comparing a subset between reviewers and testing for inter-rater agreement using Cohen’s kappa test. Studies deemed relevant at full text were coded against bibliographic, inclusion and study design criteria to create a searchable database of evidence. Searches retrieved over 15,700 results yet only sixteen cases met criteria for inclusion in the systematic map. Most of this evidence represents first records of impacts from different areas, and in particular first reports of transmission of exotic diseases by introduced mosquito species. There is currently limited published evidence demonstrating a change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts caused by alien species in Europe over the last 25&amp;nbsp;years. Relevant studies relate to only a few species, often report specific cases and rarely link health impacts with ecology, distribution or spread of the species. Difficulties in attributing human health impacts, such as stings or allergies, to a specific alien species likely complicate attempts to measure changes, as may differences in professional interests between the environmental and health professions. Future studies could helpfully compare spread or abundance with reported, rather than potential, health impacts. Better cooperation between invasion ecologists and health professionals working in affected areas are likely to be necessary to improve the evidence base on this topic for the future."/>

Climate change and the increasing magnitude and frequency of introductions of species across geographic barriers as a result of international trade are likely to change their establishment, spread, abundance, physiology or phenology, potentially also altering their human health impacts. Yet despite receiving increasing attention in the scientific literature, there have been few attempts to quantify recent changes in human health impacts. Here we report the findings from a systematic map of the literature identifying evidence of any change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of impacts of alien species on human health in Europe over the last 25 years.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Methods</h3><p>We conducted a systematic search of the ecological and medical literature using English language search terms to identify potentially relevant studies. Search results were assessed against inclusion criteria published in an a priori protocol at title, abstract and full-text to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Repeatability was checked at each stage by comparing a subset between reviewers and testing for inter-rater agreement using Cohen’s kappa test. Studies deemed relevant at full text were coded against bibliographic, inclusion and study design criteria to create a searchable database of evidence.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>Searches retrieved over 15,700 results yet only sixteen cases met criteria for inclusion in the systematic map. Most of this evidence represents first records of impacts from different areas, and in particular first reports of transmission of exotic diseases by introduced mosquito species.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusions</h3><p>There is currently limited published evidence demonstrating a change in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts caused by alien species in Europe over the last 25 years. Relevant studies relate to only a few species, often report specific cases and rarely link health impacts with ecology, distribution or spread of the species. Difficulties in attributing human health impacts, such as stings or allergies, to a specific alien species likely complicate attempts to measure changes, as may differences in professional interests between the environmental and health professions. Future studies could helpfully compare spread or abundance with reported, rather than potential, health impacts. Better cooperation between invasion ecologists and health professionals working in affected areas are likely to be necessary to improve the evidence base on this topic for the future.</p></div></div></section>

<p>To date, there have been few attempts to systematically identify or quantify the extent of alien species impacts on human health. A recent review by Schindler et al. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Schindler S, Staska B, Adam M, Rabitsch W, Essl F.

Further, research on this topic appears biased towards a few species, hindering a balanced understanding of the scale, patterns and trends of these impacts [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Schindler S, Staska B, Adam M, Rabitsch W, Essl F.

Scores were compared using Cohen’s Kappa test [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 13" title="Cohen J.

All titles without agreement across all three reviewers were discussed to determine which should be included or excluded; disagreements generally resulted from either a difference of opinion as to how generally the criteria should be applied or a difference in reviewer knowledge (for example if a reviewer was unsure of whether a location or a species met the inclusion criteria they might keep in an article for further checking that had been excluded by the other reviewers). This resulted in a refined understanding of the inclusion criteria, as reflected above.</p><p>A second set of 100 references, randomly generated in the same way as the first set, were also assessed at title by the same reviewers to measure whether inter-rater agreement had improved following refinement of the criteria. Kappa scores were good (0.658, 0.718 and 0.650) with 82% complete agreement between reviewers, suggesting an improvement in consistency as to how the inclusion criteria were applied.</p><p>A further set of 100 randomly selected abstracts were assessed independently by all three reviewers and inter-rater agreement again scored using Cohen’s kappa test. Reviewers were in complete agreement over 63% of the abstracts (either scored Y/Y/Y or N/N/N). Kappa scores were moderate to good (0.518; 0.733 and 0.579 between reviewer-pairs).</p><p>All articles selected as meeting the review inclusion criteria at full-text and subjected to study coding were assessed independently by two reviewers to check for consistency and any discrepancies discussed with a third reviewer if agreement could not be reached.

Despite clear risks to human health from a number of alien species (there are multiple cases of skin burns following exposure to the sap of <i>Heracleum mantegazzianum</i> reported in the literature, for example [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Chan JCY, Sullivan PJ, O’Sullivan MJ, Eadie PA.

Much of the evidence contained within this map refers to cases of illness or injury that demonstrates an impact where it has not been reported previously, rather than demonstrating any temporal change. The lack of evidence suitable for inclusion in this systematic map appear to be in part due to challenges in linking ecological factors such as abundance or spread with actual human health impacts (as opposed to potential health impacts as inferred by pollen loadings or vector competence). This indeed implies rather complex study designs, because at first temporal change in species distribution or abundance and temporal change in impact must be assessed, and additionally it is required that these two temporal changes are set into relation with each other and evidence must be provided for the relation among them (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4#Fig3">3</a>). However, lacking evidence probably also reflects a lack of central recording for injuries caused by alien species, and reflects difficulties in attributing impacts to a specific species e.g. in the case of allergies, stings, or in identifying the specific vector where there are a range of native and introduced candidate species, and this may complicate attempts to measure changes. It is likely that many cases are attributed at a broad level (e.g. an allergy to pollen) and that assessment of causal species (of which there may be multiple affecting any given individual) is not worth pursuing by primary care practitioners as it would be unlikely to affect the course of treatment required.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-3"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig3" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 3</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4/figures/3" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0100-4/MediaObjects/13750_2017_100_Fig3_HTML.gif?as=webp"></source><img aria-describedby="figure-3-desc" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13750-017-0100-4/MediaObjects/13750_2017_100_Fig3_HTML.gif" alt="figure3" loading="lazy" /></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-3-desc"><p>Drivers of global change cause changes in the distribution and abundance of health-relevant alien species, with resulting implications for human health (relevant data highlighted in <i>red</i>).

<p>Perhaps the greatest threat to human health in Europe currently posed by alien species is the transmission of exotic diseases by non-native arthropods. Some pathogens have the potential to significantly affect large numbers of citizens within relatively short time frames, as demonstrated for example by the outbreak of Chikungunya fever in Italy (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 32" title="Schaffner F, Medlock JM, Bortel W. Public health significance of invasive mosquitoes in Europe. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2013;19:685–92." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4#ref-CR32" id="ref-link-section-d81803e1497">32</a>]). Despite a relative lack of evidence within this map on allergenic plant species, sensitivity to <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> appears to be increasing in Europe. There is much data available in the literature (for example on pollen loads and season lengths) that suggests the spread of this allergenic species will continue to increase the burden on health care systems resulting from the treatment of long-term allergic conditions. Other health impacts are likely to result from either potentially high contact but temporally and geographically restricted events associated with seasonal abundance of species with cyclic populations, or ad hoc events resulting from random encounters such as envenomations by <i>V. velutina</i>. Increased monitoring and reporting is critical to establish baselines in impact data and identify any geographic and temporal trends.</p><p>For many health-relevant alien species, knowledge gaps must be interpreted as lack of accessible data rather than providing evidence of no impact. It may be the case that evidence exists but it is not accessible using standard systematic reviewing or mapping methodologies, and that alternative methods (for example, compiling data from press reports or accessing national medical records or databases) must be used to increase the information available in this area. For many alien species, existing evidence of health impacts did not fit the inclusion criteria for this map (for example ad hoc case reports referring to injuries sustained following contact with <i>H. mantegazzianum</i> as mentioned above) and this may be a suitable topic for a future evidence map to help quantify the health impacts of alien species. Regardless, a lack of baseline data on the health impacts of alien species is concerning as without this evidence it is difficult to establish how much of a risk these species pose to human health currently and in the foreseeable future and therefore to determine an appropriate management response. Further, without a better understanding of which species pose a tangible threat and where, it is difficult to justify or target awareness raising measures for relevant primary care workers, meaning that patients may not receive an accurate or as rapid diagnosis as possible.</p><p>Although there is relatively little direct evidence of trends in health impacts of alien species in Europe, there is much related literature that did not fit the criteria for inclusion in this systematic map but which may provide valuable information to help inform decisions. Examples of this indirect evidence not contained within the map include:</p><ul class="u-list-style-bullet"><li><p>Individual case reports. Although these case reports provide valuable evidence that a given species is having an impact (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 31" title="Chan JCY, Sullivan PJ, O’Sullivan MJ, Eadie PA.

An exception is where a case report represents the first report of an impact from a new area as it shows that the alien species is present where it previously was not. This information was included in the map.</p></li><li><p>Studies looking at vector competence.

<p>Given the limited evidence base available, it is difficult to currently assess the extent of the impacts of alien species on human health, let alone determine whether global change is driving changes in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts and, if so, in which directions. Better linking between data on spread/abundance and human health impacts over time (and ideally from the point of introduction onwards for species that are not yet established or still spreading) are required to explore this issue further, and are likely to require collaborative approaches between the environmental and the health communities. The taxonomic and geographical biases in the available data make it difficult to draw broader conclusions about changes in health impacts as they may not transfer across species or regions. For established alien species that are widespread, studies correlating health impacts against abundance or comparing different climatic conditions (such as annual rainfall) or management regimes on health outcomes may be valuable in helping to determine their impacts. For more recently introduced species, studies mapping health impacts may help to monitor spread, focus awareness raising activities aimed at minimising exposure, and provide justification for action aimed at containing the species within a restricted area if eradication is not possible. However, this research suggests that these types of studies are still relatively rare in the scientific literature.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec19">Limitations of the map</h3><p>Systematic reviews and maps aim to undertake comprehensive searches using bibliographic databases, but it is impossible to undertake exhaustive searches of all potentially relevant sources due to resourcing and language constraints. Even within the results retrieved for this systematic map, there are a number of studies that were unobtainable or published in languages other than English, and so have not been included in the final evidence base. As with any systematic review or map, it is also possible that some relevant studies may have been missed during the searching or screening processes as a result of human error, unclear reporting by the primary authors or use of different terminology from that used here. Further, studies in which relevant species are grouped generally with other (native) species are unlikely to have been detected without specific reference to the search terms identified here. However, this map provides the most comprehensive collection of evidence on this topic to date, and highlights some important limitations that need to be addressed to develop this evidence base in the future.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec20">Revisiting the conceptual model</h3><p>We believe the conceptual model originally presented in our protocol, although simplistic, to be generally correct. However, we expand it out to include the different types of data that relate to each of the components (Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4#Fig3">3</a>) and highlight knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research. The topic of this systematic map (in red in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4#Fig3">3</a>) suggests that there have been relatively few studies directly linking either changes in the abundance or spread of alien species with the human health impacts with which they are associated. However, other areas identified within our conceptual diagram—effectiveness of management of either species or health impacts—are potential topics for further study. For example, data exist on the effectiveness of management of <i>A. artemisiifolia</i> (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Milakovic I, Fiedler K, Karrer G.

However, given the lack of suitable data identified on this topic at the current time, there are no plans to conduct an update in the near future. Running and title screening the searches in the core databases over a restricted time period should provide an idea as to whether there is much potential evidence being published and should be undertaken before an update is commenced.</p></div></div></section><section aria-labelledby="Sec22"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec22-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec22">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec22-content"><p>There is some evidence for changes in the human health impacts of alien species within Europe over the last 25 years. However, compared to the relevance of the topic for human well-being (e.g. [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 44" title="Rabitsch W, Essl F, Schindler S. The rise of non-native vectors and reservoirs of human diseases. In: Vila M, Hulme PE, editors. Impact of biological invasions on ecosystem services, vol. 12. Cham: Invading Nature—Springer Series in Invasion Ecology; 2017. p. 263–75." href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4#ref-CR44" id="ref-link-section-d81803e1632">44</a>]), there are few studies demonstrating changes in health impacts over time mapped to changing spread or abundance of the alien species. Relevant studies relate to only a few species, often report specific cases or outbreaks, and rarely link health impacts with ecology, distribution or spread of the species, or with public health. Difficulties in attributing human health impacts such as stings or allergies to a specific species likely complicate attempts to measure changes, as do different research interests between ecologists and health professionals. Better cooperation between invasion ecologists, health professionals and others working in affected areas are likely to be necessary to improve the evidence base on this topic for the future.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23">Implications for policy/management</h3><p>There is a clear need for better recording/reporting of impacts to determine whether particular alien species present a human health issue or not, to identify any trends (such as changes in impacts) and to inform policy and management appropriately. We recommend that a precautionary approach is adopted towards species likely to pose a threat to human health, and particularly for those species with demonstrable health impacts noted elsewhere. Prevention, detection and rapid response should be prioritised for species of highest concern and risk not yet present and preparations made to raise awareness among relevant professionals (e.g. doctors, environmental managers) and publics most likely to encounter the species (e.g. swimmers, gardeners as appropriate) to facilitate identification and minimise impacts resulting from exposure. For species already present in an area, more thorough assessment of the scale of impacts to date would be valuable in justifying the case for management (or otherwise), and in helping to inform other areas not yet affected by the potential impacts. Depending on the species of concern, alternative forms of data such as vector competence or population sensitivity may be necessary to underpin prioritisation or management decisions until suitable evidence regarding absolute trends in health impacts have been established.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24">Implications for health professionals</h3><p>Better awareness of the issue of alien species with potential health impacts among health professionals may be desirable to aid in diagnosing and, in relevant cases, reporting. In particular, knowledge of emerging threats from species that have been recently introduced or are likely to arrive (so called ‘alert species’) could aid in tracking spread, assessing impacts and prioritising management. Understanding seasonal, temporal and geographical changes in the frequency or severity of symptoms associated with specific species (if possible to determine) could also aid in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This may require a mechanism by which impacts can be reported and recorded to contribute to an evidence base in this area, similar to those used for notifiable diseases. For now, we strongly advocate that health professionals report unusual health impacts relating to alien species in the scientific literature.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec25">Implications for research</h3><p>Researchers could helpfully aim to link reported human health impacts with ecological aspects to expand the evidence base on this potentially important topic, rather than studying one or the other in isolation—in particular studies matching data on spread or abundance over time to recorded health impacts would be beneficial (i.e. linking data contained within the red box in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13750-017-0100-4#Fig3">3</a>), rather than using proxy measures or inferring links. Longer term datasets will prove important in assessing any potential changes in impacts, even if just to compare levels of sensitisation or impact on the population. For example, studies reporting sensitisation rates to <i>Ambrosia</i> or impacts resulting from exposure to harmful algal blooms could usefully include data from multiple years to see whether levels change over time. Also, related areas (for example vector competence) may provide a useful tool for assessing risk but a better understanding of how these translate into actual health impacts is necessary, particularly where actual impacts may differ due to different physical, environmental or climatic conditions between different parts of the affected range. This requires collaborative working between both research communities but may also open up new funding avenues for researchers wishing to conduct studies at the interface between ecology or biogeography and human health.</p></div></div></section>
