Have wet meadow restoration projects in the
Southwestern U.S. been effective in restoring
geomorphology, hydrology, soils, and plant
species composition?
Karissa M Ramstead1, James A Allen1* and Abraham E Springer2
  Abstract
  Background: Wet meadows occur in numerous locations throughout the American Southwest, but in many cases
  have become heavily degraded. Among other things they have frequently been overgrazed and have had roads
  built through them, which have affected the hydrology of these wetland ecosystems.
  Because of the important hydrologic and ecological functions they are believed to perform, there is currently
  significant interest in wet meadow restoration. Several restoration projects have been completed recently or are
  underway in the region, sometimes at considerable expense and with minimal monitoring. The objective of this
  review was to evaluate the effects of wet meadow restoration projects in the southwestern United States on
  geomorphology, hydrology, soils and plant species composition. A secondary objective was to determine the
  effects of wet meadow restoration projects on wildlife.
  Methods: Electronic databases, internet search engines, websites and personal contacts were used to find articles
  of relevance to this review. Articles were filtered by title, abstract and full text. Summary information for each of the
  articles remaining after the filtering process was compiled and used to assess the quality of the evidence presented
  using two different approaches.
  Results: Our searches yielded 48 articles, of which 25 were published in peer-reviewed journals, 14 were
  monitoring or project reports, and 9 were published in conference proceedings or are unpublished theses or
  manuscripts.
  A total of 26 operational-scale restoration projects were identified. A wide range of restoration techniques were
  employed, ranging from small-scale manipulations of stream channels (e.g., riffle structures) to large scale pond-
  and-plug projects. Other common restoration techniques included fencing to exclude livestock (and sometimes
  also native ungulates), other forms of grazing management, seeding, and transplanting seedlings.
  Most of the articles reported that restoration was fully or partially effective, at least in the short-term. However, the
  relative lack of high quality quantitative data, and especially data extending more than two years after project
  implementation, greatly limits our ability to determine how effective restoration has truly been in practice.

  Conclusions: While caution is warranted due to data quality limitations, progress has been made over the past 20
  years in wet meadow restoration. In particular, important contributions have been made in restoring the highly
  degraded wet meadow systems that are characterized by deep, wide and relatively straight gullies. There is
  evidence, for example, that the pond-and-plug approach is an effective technique for restoring many aspects of
  these systems, albeit at the cost of creating new features (ponds) that are not necessarily natural features of wet
  meadows.
  There is a need to allocate additional effort to project documentation, including better-designed and longer-lasting
  monitoring programs. One approach that might help is for practitioners to work with scientists from government
  agencies, local universities and colleges, and other organizations. When this type of collaboration has happened in
  the past it appears to have been effective. Many important lessons could have been learned, and mistakes avoided,
  if more effort had been put into documenting both successes and failures of past projects.
