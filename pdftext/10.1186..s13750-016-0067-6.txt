  Abstract
  Background: Agriculture and agricultural intensification can have significant negative impacts on the environment,
  including nutrient and pesticide leaching, spreading of pathogens, soil erosion and reduction of ecosystem services
  provided by terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. The establishment and management of vegetated strips adjacent
  to farmed fields (including various field margins, buffer strips and hedgerows) are key mitigation measures for these
  negative environmental impacts and environmental managers and other stakeholders must often make decisions
  about how best to design and implement vegetated strips for a variety of different outcomes. However, it may be
  difficult to obtain relevant, accurate and summarised information on the effects of implementation and management
  of vegetated strips, even though a vast body of evidence exists on multipurpose vegetated strip interventions within
  and around fields. To improve the situation, we describe a method for assembling a database of relevant research
  relating to vegetated strips undertaken in boreo-temperate farming systems (arable, pasture, horticulture, orchards
  and viticulture), according to the primary question: What evidence exists regarding the effects of field margins on
  nutrients, pollutants, socioeconomics, biodiversity, and soil retention?
  Methods: We will search 13 bibliographic databases, one search engine and 37 websites for stakeholder organisa‑
  tions using a predefined and tested search string that focuses on a comprehensive list of vegetated strip synonyms.
  Non-English language searches in Danish, Finnish, German, Spanish, and Swedish will also be undertaken using a
  web-based search engine. We will screen search results at title, abstract and full text levels, recording the number of
  studies deemed non-relevant (with reasons at full text). A systematic map database that displays the meta-data (i.e.
  descriptive summary information about settings and methods) of relevant studies will be produced following full text
  assessment. The systematic map database will be displayed as a web-based geographical information system (GIS).
  The nature and extent of the evidence base will be discussed.

tiple spatial and temporal scales [8]. The establishment
and management of vegetated strips (including field
margins, buffer strips and hedgerows) are key mitigation
measures for these negative environmental impacts [9].
Definition of vegetated strips
Here, we define vegetative strips as any vegetated area
set-aside from the main cropping regime within or
around a field, and installed for the purposes of benefit-
ing native biota, water and air quality, socio-econom-
ics, and yield. Examples of such interventions include:
hedgerows, field margins, buffer strips, beetlebanks and                   Fig. 2 Conceptual model of pathways to impact for vegetated strips
