   Abstract
   Background: Agriculture is the main sector responsible for nutrient emissions in the Baltic Sea Region and there is
   a growing pressure to identify cost-effective solutions towards reducing nitrogen and phosphorus loads originating
   from farming activities. Recycling resources from agricultural waste is central to the idea of a circular economy, and
   has the potential to address the most urgent problems related to nutrients use in the food chain, such as depletion of
   natural phosphorus reserves, water pollution and waste management. This systematic map examined what evidence
   exists relating to the effectiveness of ecotechnologies in agriculture for the recovery and reuse of carbon and/or nutri-
   ents (nitrogen and phosphorus) in the Baltic Sea region and other comparable boreo-temperate systems.
   Methods: We searched for both academic and grey literature. English language searches were performed in 5 bib-
   liographic databases and search platforms, and Google Scholar. Searches in 36 specialist websites were performed in
   English, Finnish, Polish and Swedish. The searches were restricted to the period 2013 to 2017. Eligibility screening was
   conducted at two levels: title and abstract (screened concurrently for efficiency) and full text. Meta-data was extracted
   from eligible studies including bibliographic details, study location, ecotechnology name and description, type of
   outcome (i.e. recovered or reused carbon and/or nutrients), type of ecotechnology in terms of recovery source, and
   type of reuse (in terms of the end-product). Findings are presented here narratively and in a searchable database, and
   are also visualised in a web-based evidence atlas (an interactive geographical information system). In addition, knowl-
   edge gaps and clusters have been identified in the evidence base and described in detail.
   Results: We found 173 articles studying the effectiveness of 177 ecotechnologies. The majority of eligible articles
   were in English, originated from bibliographic databases and were published in 2016. Most studies with reported
   locations, and given our boreo-temperate scope, were conducted in Europe and North America. The three most
   prevalent ecotechnologies in the evidence base (collectively 40.7%) were; soil amendments, anaerobic digestion
   and (vermi)composting. Manure was the principal waste source used for recovery of nutrients or carbon, making up
   55.4% of the all studies in evidence base, followed by a combination of manure and crop residues (22%). There were
   51 studies with 14 ecotechnologies that reported on recovery of carbon and nutrients together, predominantly via

  through soil amendments.
  Conclusions: This systematic map report provides an evidence base that can be useful for researchers and decision-
  makers in policy and practice working on transformation from linear to circular economy in the agricultural waste
  sector. Three potential topics for future systematic reviews are: (1) effectiveness of products recovered from different
  types of agricultural wastes as soil amendments or fertilizers; (2) effectiveness of anaerobic digestion as an ecotech-
  nology used for recovery of nutrients and carbon; (3) effectiveness of composting and/or vermicomposting as
  ecotechnologies used for recovery of nutrients and carbon.
