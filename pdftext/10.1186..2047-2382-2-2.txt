Assessing community-based conservation
projects: A systematic review and multilevel
analysis of attitudinal, behavioral, ecological, and
economic outcomes
Jeremy Brooks1, Kerry Ann Waylen2 and Monique Borgerhoff Mulder3*
  Abstract
  Background: Community-based conservation (CBC) promotes the idea that long-term conservation success
  requires engaging with, and providing benefits for local communities. Though widespread, CBC projects are not
  always successful or free of controversy. With criticisms on all sides of the conservation debates, it is critical to have
  a better understanding of (1) whether CBC is an effective conservation tool, and (2) of the factors associated with
  the success or failure of CBC projects, and the scale at which these factors operate. Recent CBC reviews have
  typically examined only a single resource domain, have limited geographic scope, consider only one outcome, or
  ignore the nested nature of socioecological systems. To remedy these issues, we use a newly coded global
  comparative database of CBC projects identified by systematic review to evaluate success in four outcome domains
  (attitudes, behaviors, ecological, economic) and explore synergies and tradeoffs among these outcomes. We test
  hypotheses about how features of the national context (H-NC), project design (H-PD), and local community
  characteristics (H-CC) affect these four measures of success.
  Methods: To add to a sample of 62 projects that we used from previous systematic reviews, we systematically
  searched the conservation literature using six terms in four online databases. To increase the number of projects for
  each country in order to conduct a multilevel analysis, we also conducted a secondary search using the Advancing
  Conservation in a Social Context online library. We coded projects for 65 pieces of information. We conducted
  bivariate analyses using two-dimensional contingency tables and proportional odds logistic regression and
  conducted multivariate analyses by fitting reduced form proportional odds logistic regression models that were
  selected using a forward stepwise AIC approach.
  Results: The primary and secondary searches produced 74 new projects to go along with the 62 projects from
  previous reviews for a total of 136 projects. The analyses suggest that project design, particularly capacity building
  in local communities, is critical in generating success across all outcomes. In addition, some community
  characteristics, such as tenure regimes and supportive cultural beliefs and institutions, are important for some
  aspects of project success. Surprisingly, there is less evidence that national context systematically influences project
  outcomes.

  Conclusions: Our study supports the idea that conservation projects should be carefully designed to be effective
  and that some characteristics of local communities can facilitate success. That well-designed projects can prevail
  over disadvantages relating to the pre-existing national and local context is encouraging. As the evidence base on
  CBC grows, it will be useful to repeat this analysis with additional search terms, and consider additional variables
  related to national context to further evaluate the role of broader socio-political and economic contexts.
