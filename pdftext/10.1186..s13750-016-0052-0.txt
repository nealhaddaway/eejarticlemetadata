  Abstract
  Background: Soils contain the greatest terrestrial carbon (C) pool on the planet. Since approximately 12 % of soil C
  is held in cultivated soils, management of these agricultural areas has a huge potential to affect global carbon cycling;
  acting sometimes as a sink but also as a source. Tillage is one of the most important agricultural practices for soil
  management and has been traditionally undertaken to mechanically prepare soils for seeding and minimize effects
  of weeds. It has been associated with many negative impacts on soil quality, most notably a reduction in soil organic
  carbon (SOC), although still a matter of considerable debate, depending on factors such as depth of measurement,
  soil type, and tillage method. No tillage or reduced intensity tillage are frequently proposed mitigation measures for
  preservation of SOC and improvement of soil quality, for example for reducing erosion. Whilst several reviews have
  demonstrated benefits to C conservation of no till agriculture over intensive tillage, the general picture for reduced
  tillage intensity is unclear. This systematic review proposes to synthesise an extensive body of evidence, previously
  identified through a systematic map.
  Methods: This systematic review is based on studies concerning tillage collated in a recently completed systematic
  map on the impact of agricultural management on SOC restricted to the warm temperate climate zone (i.e. boreo-
  temperate). These 311 studies were identified and selected systematically according to CEE guidelines. An update of
  the original search will be undertaken to identify newly published academic and grey literature in the time since the
  original search was performed in September 2013. Studies will be critically appraised for their internal and external
  validity, followed by full data extraction (meta-data describing study settings and quantitative study results). Where
  possible, studies will be included in meta-analyses examining the effect of tillage reduction (‘moderate’ (i.e. shallow)
  and no tillage relative to ‘intensive’ tillage methods such as mouldboard ploughing, where soil is turned over through‑
  out the soil profile). The implications of the findings will be discussed in terms of policy, practice and research along
  with a discussion of the nature of the evidence base.
