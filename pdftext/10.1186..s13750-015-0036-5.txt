  Abstract
  Background: An extensive body of literature in the field of agro-ecology claims to show the positive effects that
  maintenance of ecosystem services can have on sustainably meeting future food demand, by making farms more
  productive and resilient, and contributing to better nutrition and livelihoods of farmers. In Africa alone, some
  research has estimated a two-fold yield increase if food producers capitalize on new and existing knowledge from
  science and technology. Site-specific strategies adopted with the aim of improving ecosystem services may
  incorporate principles of multifunctional agriculture, sustainable intensification and conservation agriculture.
  However, a coherent synthesis and review of the evidence of these claims is largely absent, and the quality of much
  of this literature is questionable. Moreover, inconsistent effects have commonly been reported, while empirical
  evidence to support assumed improvements is largely lacking.
  Objectives: This systematic map is stimulated by an interest to (1) collate evidence on the effectiveness of on-farm
  conservation land management for preserving and enhancing ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, by
  drawing together the currently fragmented and multidisciplinary literature base, and (2) geographically map what
  indicators have been used to assess on-farm conservation land management. For both questions, we will focus on
  74 low-income and developing countries, where much of the world’s agricultural expansion is occurring, yet 80% of
  arable land is already used and croplands are yielding well below their potential.
  Methods/Design: To this end, reviewers will systematically search bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research
  from Web of Science, SCOPUS, AGRICOLA, AGRIS databases and CAB abstracts, and grey literature from Google Scholar,
  and 22 subject-specific or institutional websites. Boolean search operators will be used to create search strings where
  applicable. Ecosystem services included in the study are pollination services; pest-, carbon-, soil-, and water-regulation;
  nutrient cycling; medicinal and aromatic plants; fuel wood and cultural services. Outputs of the systematic map will
  include a database, technical report and an online interactive map, searchable by topic. The results of this map are
  expected to provide clarity about synergistic outcomes of conservation land management, which will help support
  local decision-making.
