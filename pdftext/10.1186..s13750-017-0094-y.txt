How does roadside vegetation
management affect the diversity of vascular
plants and invertebrates? A systematic review
protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Roadsides have been acknowledged as potential substitutes for semi-natural grasslands and other
  open habitats with high biodiversity, many of which are now declining. Current recommendations for roadside
  management to promote conservation of biodiversity are largely based on studies of plants in meadows or pastures,
  although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes.
  Stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted guidelines for roadside management, based on
  actual roadside studies. We recently performed a systematic mapping of the evidence on how roadside management
  affects biodiversity and the dispersal of species. Through this process, we found 98 studies on how the richness or
  abundance of species on roadsides is affected by management such as regular mowing, burning, grazing or selective
  mechanical removal of plants. Since all of these interventions entail removal of plant biomass, they are comparable.
  Most of the studies recorded management effects on vascular plants, but there were 14 investigations of insects and
  other invertebrates. We now intend to proceed with a full systematic review of how maintenance or restoration of
  roadsides based on non-chemical vegetation removal affects the diversity of vascular plants and invertebrates.
  Methods: Most of the evidence on which the proposed systematic review is to be based will be selected from the
  systematic map. To identify more recently published literature on the topic of the review, we will perform a search
  update using a subset of the search terms applied for the systematic map. The criteria for inclusion of studies will be
  the same as for the map, except that interventions and outcomes will be restricted to those relevant to the review.
  Relevant studies will be subject to critical appraisal and categorised as having high or low validity for the review. Stud-
  ies with low validity will be excluded from the review. Utilisable data on outcomes, interventions and other potential
  effect modifiers will be extracted from included articles. A narrative synthesis will describe the validity and findings
  of all studies in the review. Where a sufficient number of studies report similar outcome types, meta-analysis will be
  conducted.
