  Abstract
  Background: Floodplains are among the most diverse, dynamic, productive and populated but also the most
  threatened ecosystems on Earth. Threats are mainly related to human activities that alter the landscape and disrupt
  fluvial processes to obtain benefits related to multiple ecosystem services (ESS). Floodplain management therefore
  requires close coordination among interest groups with competing claims and poses multi-dimensional challenges
  to policy-makers and project managers. The European Commission proposed in its recent Biodiversity Strategy to
  maintain and enhance European ecosystems and their services by establishing green infrastructure (GI). GI is
  assumed to provide multiple ecosystem functions and services including the conservation of biodiversity in the
  same spatial area. However, evidence for biodiversity benefits of multifunctional floodplain management is
  scattered and has not been synthesised.
  Methods/design: This protocol specifies the methods for conducting a systematic review to answer the following
  policy-relevant questions: a) what is the impact of floodplain management measures on biodiversity; b) how does the
  impact vary according to the level of multifunctionality of the measures; c) is there a difference in the biodiversity
  impact of floodplain management across taxa; d) what is the effect of the time since implementation on the impact of
  the most important measures; and e) are there any other factors that significantly modify the biodiversity impact of
  floodplain management measures? Within this systematic review we will assess multifunctionality in terms of ESS that
  are affected by an implemented intervention. Biodiversity indicators included in this systematic review will be related to
  the diversity, richness and abundance of species, other taxa or functional groups. We will consider if organisms are
  typical for and native to natural floodplain ecosystems. Specific inclusion criteria have been developed and the wide
  range of quality of primary literature will be evaluated with a tailor-made system for assessing susceptibility to bias and
  the reliability of the studies. The review is intended to bridge the science-policy interface and will provide a useful
  synthesis of knowledge for decision-makers at all governance levels.
