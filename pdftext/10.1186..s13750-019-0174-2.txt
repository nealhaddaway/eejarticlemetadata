The relative effectiveness of seed addition
methods for restoring or re‑creating species rich
grasslands: a systematic review protocol
Daniel Slodowicz* , Jean‑Yves Humbert and Raphaël Arlettaz
  Abstract
  Background: Extensively managed grasslands in temperate biomes are capable of harboring a big variety of plant
  and invertebrate species. Yet, they have suffered from a strong decline in the past decades mainly due to agricultural
  intensification. Agri-environment schemes have been introduced in Europe in order to promote farmland biodiver‑
  sity, but they were only little effective, especially so in grasslands. Not surprisingly, grassland restoration and recrea‑
  tion through active seed addition has thus gained in importance in the recent years. The most common methods
  used rely either on the addition of commercial seed mixes, on the addition of seeds collected from a speciose donor
  grassland or on transferring hay from a speciose donor grassland after the soil of the receiver site has been prepared
  (ploughing, harrowing or topsoil removal). While there is evidence that these restoration methods may contribute to
  improve the biodiversity of grasslands, especially plant diversity, their relative effectiveness remains poorly known. The
  aim of this systematic review is to scrutinize the peer-reviewed literature for scientific evidence about comparative
  effectiveness.
  Methods: We will search for peer-reviewed journal articles in bibliographic databases and grey literature in search
  engines and organizational websites dealing with at least one of the above mentioned seed addition methods. We
  will only include studies which were carried out in temperate Europe. Through a scoping exercise a search string was
  developed which was based on a previously prepared test-list. The search string was then tested for validity with two
  independent reference lists. Screening will be done on the title, abstract and full-text level and consistency checking
  will be done on a random subsample by a second reviewer. After critically appraising internal validity of the retained
  studies, data on the responses of plants and invertebrates as well as all relevant meta-data will be extracted and
  coded. A meta-analysis will be conducted on studies with high internal validity whereas a narrative analysis will be
  done with descriptive statistics on studies with medium internal validity. Potential effect modifiers like study duration,
  former land use or local climate will be included in the analysis as moderators.
