  Abstract
  Background: Antibiotic resistance is a major concern for public and environmental health. The role played by the
  environment in disseminating resistance is increasingly considered, as well as its capacity for mitigation. We reviewed
  the literature on strategies to control dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), antibiotic resistance genes
  (ARG) and mobile genetic elements (MGE) in the environment.
  Methods: This systematic review focused on three main strategies: (i) restriction of antibiotic use (S1), (ii) treatments
  of liquid/solid matrices (S2) and (iii) management of natural environment (S3). Articles were collected from seven
  scientific databases until July 2017 and from Web of Science until June 2018. Only studies reporting measurements
  of ARB, ARG or MGE in environmental samples were included. An evidence map was drawn from metadata extracted
  from all studies eligible for S1, S2 and S3. Subsets of studies were assessed for internal and external validity to perform
  narrative and quantitative syntheses. A meta-analysis was carried out to assess the effects of organic waste treatments
  (random-effect models).
  Review findings: Nine hundred and thirty-one articles representing 1316 individual studies (n) were eligible for S1
  (n = 59), S2 (n = 781) and S3 (n = 476) strategies, respectively. Effects of interventions to control the dissemination of
  antibiotic resistance in the environment were primarily studied in strategy S2. A partial efficiency of wastewater treat‑
  ment plants (WWTPs) to reduce antibiotic resistance in treated effluent was reported in 118 high validity studies. In
  spite of the heterogeneity in published results, the meta-analysis showed that composting and drying were efficient
  treatments to reduce the relative abundance of ARG and MGE in organic waste, by 84% [65%; 93%] and 98% [80%;
  100%], respectively. The effect of anaerobic digestion was not statistically significant (51% reduction [− 2%; 77%])
  when organic waste treatments were compared together in the same model. Studies in strategies S1 and S3 mainly
  assessed the effects of exposure to sources of contamination. For instance, 28 medium/high validity studies showed
  an increase of antibiotic resistance in aquatic environments at the WWTP discharge point. Some of these studies also
  showed a decrease of resistance as the distance from the WWTP increases, related to a natural resilience capacity
  of aquatic environments. Concerning wildlife, nine medium/high validity studies showed that animals exposed to
  anthropogenic activities carried more ARB.

   Conclusions and implications: Knowledge gaps were identified for the relationship between restriction of antibi‑
   otic use and variation of antibiotic resistance in the environment, as well as on possible interventions in situ in natural
   environment. Organic waste treatments with thermophilic phase (> 50 °C) should be implemented before the use/
   release of organic waste in the environment. More investigation should be conducted with the datasets available in
   this review to determine the treatment efficiency on ARG carried by specific bacterial communities.

Eligible outcomes for ATBR in environment
ATBR defined as:
Antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) measured through culture-based methods:
Concentration or absolute abundance, e.g., in colony forming unit (CFU) per volume or mass of sample
Proportion or relative abundance in % resistant isolates in the measured bacterial population (e.g., total culturable bacteria, total Escherichia coli isolates)
Antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and mobile genetic elements (MGE) measured through molecular methods:
Concentration or absolute abundance in gene copies per volume or mass of samples
Proportion or relative abundance in gene copies per total microbial biomass, e.g., estimated by the 16S sub-unit of ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA genes copies)
Concentrations/Absolute abundances were used for risk assessment associated to the presence of ARB, ARG and MGE
Proportions/Relative abundances were used for quantitative comparisons since the I/E can also impact the total microbial biomass and to overcome the difference between matrices
Environmental samples defined as liquid (e.g. wastewater) and solid matrices (e.g. sewage sludge, livestock manure), natural environment samples including water and sediment from aquatic envi‑
  ronment, soil and biological samples from wildlife
Eligible study types
 Inclusion: laboratory-scale and field-scale environmental studies; modelling studies only if a dataset was acquired from experiments or observations
 Exclusion: clinical studies, pure simulation studies, reviews and opinion papers even if considered as potential secondary information sources
