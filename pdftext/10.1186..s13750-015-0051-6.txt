What evidence exists on the impact
of governance type on the conservation
effectiveness of forest protected areas?
Knowledge base and evidence gaps

  Abstract
  Background: Governance processes and structures that steer social-ecological systems and in situ forest conser-
  vation strategies such as protected areas (PAs) can be crucial for effective management and improvement of the
  conservation outcomes. Nevertheless, knowledge synthesis on how types of local governance and decision-making
  modes may influence conservation outcomes of forest protected areas is lacking. This is mainly because the evidence
  on the joint relationships between governance regimes and ecological or social outcomes is generally missing and
  the knowledge comes from case studies. The research on this topic that use quasi-experimental designs aimed at
  inferring strong causal relationships is still methodologically in a development phase and the causal effects are hard
  to isolate. This map describes and maps the available qualitative and quantitative evidence from a large number and
  variety of sources, both peer-reviewed and grey literature, to answer the following question: What evidence exists on
  the impact of governance type on the conservation effectiveness of forest protected areas? This across-case system-
  atic map reveals knowledge gaps, methodological limitations of the primary research and generates a list of specific
  research questions for future research.
  Methods: Evidence was collated from multiple sources, academic and grey literature. Using predefined inclusion
  criteria generated in a published protocol, we identified and screened articles for relevance at title, abstract and full
  text. Evidence was collated using English language search terms and applying no geographical limitations. Identified
  studies were critically appraised for internal validity (appropriateness of comparator, study design, objectiveness of
  measured outcomes) and mapped using a predefined coding scheme. We mapped studies according to geographi-
  cal region, protected area characteristics, governance type, ecological and attitudinal outcomes, and comparator type.
  Results: The evidence base is limited in terms of size, quality and geographical area. We identified 57 relevant studies
  across 66 articles. The evidence base is geographically confined to Latin America and South Asia. Included studies are
  mostly of medium level of methodological detail, but frequently lack baseline, appropriate comparator or counter-
  factual to establish strong causal relationships between forest PAs with a particular governance type and a specific
  outcome. Moreover, most of the studies assess only one, primarily ecological, outcome and there were no studies
  measuring spill-over effects.
  Conclusions: The presented results call attention to the research gaps in the field of conservation governance,
  provide methodological guidelines and generate specific questions for future primary research. While conducting
  analysis of conservation intervention effects, research has to account for and report governance variables (e.g. how
