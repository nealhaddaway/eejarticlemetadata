What evidence exists on the effects
of anthropogenic noise on acoustic
communication in animals? A systematic map

  Abstract
  Background: Noise pollution is an intense, widespread anthropogenic disturbance that can have highly detrimental
  impacts on natural populations, communities, and ecosystems across the globe. One major way through which noise
  can affect wildlife is by masking acoustic signals that animals rely on and, in doing so, hindering inter- and intraspe‑
  cific communication among individuals. In response, many animals change their vocal behavior in an attempt to
  overcome the signal- and cue-masking effects of noisy environments. This can be done by changing the amplitude of
  the vocal output, shifting its frequency, or changing its temporal structure. However, to date, we still know very little
  about the ecological contexts of signal modifications in animals or their fitness consequences. We present a protocol
  for a systematic map aiming to collect and characterize all research done on animals’ signal modification in response
  to anthropogenic noise. The map will increase our understanding of the consequences of noise pollution on animal
  communication and may guide the development of new mitigation tools to alleviate any negative effects. The map
  will also allow us to identify gaps in the literature and highlight possible future research areas.
  Methods: We will collect information about different types of acoustic modifications in response to noise as well as
  information about the noise’s source and properties. The map will also include the ecological context of the signal
  modification and the fitness consequences of the modification, if measured. We will search both commercially pub‑
  lished literature and grey literature, and conduct the searches in academic journal databases, online search engines,
  and specialist websites. Articles will be screened for inclusion at title, abstract and full-text levels and will then be
  critically appraised for study robustness and validity. Data will then be extracted and coded according to categories
  informed by consultation with stakeholders. Data will be summarized in a quantitative manner, accompanied with a
  narrative review that will map our knowledge on how animals change their vocalizations in response to noise pollu‑
  tion as a function of their taxa, geographic location, noise pollution source, and vocalization type.
