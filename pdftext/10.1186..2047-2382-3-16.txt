  Abstract
  Background: International policy has sought to emphasize and strengthen the link between the conservation of
  natural ecosystems and human development. Furthermore, international conservation organizations have broadened
  their objectives beyond nature-based goals to recognize the contribution of conservation interventions in sustaining
  ecosystem services upon which human populations are dependent. While many indices have been developed to
  measure various human well-being domains, the strength of evidence to support the effects, both positive and
  negative, of conservation interventions on human well-being, is still unclear.
  Methods/Design: This protocol describes the methodology for examining the research question: What are the impacts
  of nature conservation interventions on different domains of human well-being in developing countries? Using systematic
  mapping, this study will scope and identify studies that measure the impacts of nature conservation interventions on
  human well-being at local to regional scales. The primary objective of this study is to synthesize the state and distribution
  of the existing evidence base linking conservation and human well-being. In addition, a theory of change approach will
  be used to identify and characterize the causal linkages between conservation and human well-being, with attention on
  those studies that examine the role of ecosystem services. Key trends among the resulting studies will be synthesized
  and the range of studies organized and presented in a graphical matrix illustrating the relationships between types
  of interventions and types of outcomes. Results of the study are intended to help conservation and development
  practitioners and the academic community to improve research studies and conservation practices in developing
  countries in order to achieve both conservation and human well-being outcomes.
