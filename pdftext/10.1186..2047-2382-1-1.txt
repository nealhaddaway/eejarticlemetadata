Are interventions to reduce the impact of arsenic
contamination of groundwater on human health
in developing countries effective?: a systematic
review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Chronic arsenic pollution is now recognised as a worldwide problem, with 21 countries experiencing
  arsenic groundwater contamination. It is a particularly important issue in developing countries, where groundwater
  is generally the preferred drinking source (as an alternative to polluted surface water). Technologies to remove or
  mitigate arsenic contamination of groundwater include pre-oxidation, adsorption, biological removal, and deep
  tubewells. Whilst technologies such as these may be effective in stable conditions (for example, at a laboratory
  scale), their effectiveness in real-world circumstances needs to be assessed to inform policy making.
  Methods: This protocol details our proposed methods for conducting a systematic review to identify, appraise, and
  synthesise evidence to answer the following policy-relevant questions: a) In developing countries, are interventions
  to reduce the impact of arsenic contamination of groundwater on human health effective?, and b) What factors
  enable or constrain the effectiveness of these interventions in developing countries?
