The effectiveness of non‑native
fish eradication techniques in freshwater
ecosystems: a systematic review protocol
Lisa A. Donaldson1,2* and Steven J. Cooke1,2
   Abstract
   Background: This systematic review will address the need for having a better understanding of the evidence-base
   for the effectiveness of different management techniques focussed on the eradication of non-native fish species in
   the freshwater environment. Many resource management agencies around the world attempt to eradicate non-native
   fish species to achieve management goals with respect to ecological integrity. There is a need to better understand
   the effectiveness of each management technique to provide resource managers with the information necessary to
   effectively manage aquatic resources, and to choose the best technique to yield desired outcomes given different
   ecological and biological conditions. The findings of this systematic review will inform evidence-based manage-
   ment and conservation activities for resource managers around the globe that deal with non-native fish eradication
   programs.
   Methods: This systematic review will search for, compile, summarize, and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness
   of fisheries management techniques used for the eradication of non-native fish species in global freshwater systems.
   The review will use public search engines and specialist websites, and will include both primary and grey literature.
   All studies that assess the effectiveness of a fish eradication technique, in freshwater, will be included in the review.
   Potential effect modifiers will be identified to obtain a better understanding of the factors that affect the success of
   different eradication techniques, given different environmental conditions and biological factors. Study quality will be
   assessed to allow for critical evaluation, including study design, confounding factors and statistical analysis. Data will
   be compiled into a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis will be conducted where data availability and quality allow.

Table 2 Description of inclusion criteria used by the Review Team when screening articles at the title and abstract level
Type of criteria                Description of inclusion criteria
Relevant subjects               Freshwater ecosystems, including both lakes and rivers that contain non-native fish species
Relevant types of interventions Article describes the type of eradication method used in an attempt to eradicate a fish species. Eradication method
                                  can include: mechanical, chemical, biological, environmental or other
Relevant types of comparators   An external control site: similar waterbodies with no intervention (i.e., waterbodies with non-native fish present but
                                  have not had any fish management projects conducted in them), before intervention control site within same
                                  waterbody, or an alternative intervention type conducted on the same waterbody
Relevant types of outcomes      Measured effect of treatment. Reported measured effect can be quantitative or observational and generally should
                                  indicate some change in abundance of target species relative to before treatment or control
Relevant types of study designs Given the complexity of eradication projects, all types of study designs will be examined, including but not limited to:
                                  Before/after (BA)
                                  Comparator/intervention (CI)
                                  Before/after/comparator/intervention (BACI)
                                  Randomized controlled trial (RCT)
                                Studies that do not do or report any before or after assessments following the implementation of an eradication
                                  effort will be excluded from the review (i.e., studies where no data is presented that would allow for any assessment
                                  of a change in abundance of the target species following eradication efforts)
