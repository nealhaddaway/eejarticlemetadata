   Abstract
   Background: Systematic conservation planning involves the prioritisation of conservation actions to optimise bio-
   diversity conservation outcomes whilst considering implementation challenges such as minimising costs. Thousands
   of systematic conservation plans have been developed around the globe (a popular software package, ‘Marxan’, has
   over 4200 active users from more than 180 countries). However, the effects of systematic approaches on conservation
   actions and outcomes are not generally known, nor are the factors which distinguish effective from ineffective plans.
   Previous reviews of conservation planning outcomes have been limited in scope and to narrow time intervals, and
   have revealed very few formal evaluations of plans. Given systematic approaches are widely perceived to offer the
   best chance to rapidly and efficiently achieve biodiversity protection targets, a thorough, up-to-date synthesis of the
   evidence is required.
   Methods: This protocol outlines the methodology for a systematic mapping exercise to identify retrospective studies
   measuring the effects of systematic conservation planning on biodiversity conservation at regional, national and sub-
   national scales. Our primary research question is: what is the extent and distribution of evidence on the conservation
   outcomes of systematic conservation planning? Outcomes will be categorised according to types of capital: natural,
   financial, social, human and institutional, given the range of potential direct and indirect effects of systematic con-
   servation planning on conservation outcomes. A comprehensive and repeatable search strategy will be undertaken,
   utilising a wide range of sources including grey literature sources and targeted searches of organisational websites
   and databases. Sources will be restricted to English language publications between 1983 and 2016. The resultant
   studies will be screened using standardised inclusion and exclusion criteria and data from included studies will be cat-
   egorised according to a standardised data extraction form. Information about the study design of relevant articles will
   be recorded to determine study robustness. A searchable database of studies will be made publicly accessible and
   available for updating in future. The results will be published in this journal and also presented as an interactive online
   resource to aid conservation planners in identifying impacts and outcomes of conservation plans.

The process of identifying, configuring and managing conservation resources and actions to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services
Systematic approaches to planning
Planning stages approximate those in Fig. 1, i.e. the setting of explicit conservation objectives, spatial biological data (typically multiple species and/
  or habitats), socioeconomic and other datasets, stakeholder consultation [16] and ultimately, the identification of priority areas for the allocation of
  conservation resources
Core biological principles such as representation and persistence (adequacy; achieved by applying the principles of complementarity, irreplaceability,
  connectivity and related methods [13]) are considered alongside non-biological considerations, including social and political constraints and oppor-
  tunities [36, 45]
