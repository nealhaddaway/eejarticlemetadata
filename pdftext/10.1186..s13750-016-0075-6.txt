  Abstract
  Background: Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere and its impact on the climate
  are a pressing concern for governments around the world. Reducing GHG emissions by changing the energy produc-
  tion mix is one option to reach targets being set by international communities. As the implementation of renewable
  and non-renewable energy infrastructure deployed in marine ecosystems increases, it is not clear how these changes
  will impact on the marine environment and the ecosystem services it provides. To address this knowledge gap a
  systematic mapping approach was applied, with three key aims: firstly, to provide an overview of the types of impacts
  being studied for the offshore components of nuclear, offshore oil & gas and offshore wind arrays; secondly to dem-
  onstrate how these impacts can be translated into ecosystem services; and finally to provide a searchable database of
  the results.
  Methods: Searches for relevant articles were carried out using academic and grey literature databases. A total of
  2297 articles were sourced, which were screened using selection criteria that determined which subject populations,
  exposure types and outcomes were considered relevant. To translate these findings into ecosystem service impacts,
  the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment frame-
  works were used to ensure relevance, transparency and replicability.
  Results: A total of 50 articles, which equated to 208 studies, spanning four decades since 1970, were selected and
  coded for the systematic map. Across all energy systems, benthic species were the most studied group. Following this,
  results then varied by group; marine birds and fish were most prevalent in studies of offshore wind; fish for offshore oil
  & gas studies; and pelagic organisms for nuclear. The outcome variables most investigated were changes in popula-
  tion and ecosystem function/process. Of all the ecosystem services associated with the studied impacts, regulating
  services were investigated most often, due to the large number of studies on benthic organisms. Cultural services,
  specific to offshore wind, were also prevalent.
  Discussion: The systematic map provides a searchable database of articles and their relevant studies on the local
  ecological impacts of marine renewable energies. It has identified a number of potential future areas for primary
  research; for example, investigating the impacts of decommissioning offshore energy infrastructure on marine habi-
  tats and organisms.
