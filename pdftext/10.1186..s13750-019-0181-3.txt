   Abstract
   Background: Drawing upon multiple types of knowledge (e.g., Indigenous knowledge, local knowledge, science-
   based knowledge) strengthens the evidence-base for policy advice, decision making, and environmental manage-
   ment. While the benefits of incorporating multiple types of knowledge in environmental research and management
   are many, doing so has remained a challenge. This systematic map examined the extent, range, and nature of the
   published literature (i.e., commercially published and grey) that seeks to respectively bridge Indigenous and science-
   based knowledge in coastal and marine research and management in Canada.
   Methods: This systematic map applied standardized search terms across four databases focused on commercially
   published literature, carefully selected specialist websites, and two web-based search engines. In addition, reference
   sections of relevant review articles were cross-checked to identify articles that may not have been found using the
   search strategy. Search results were screened in two sequential stages; (1) at title and abstract; and (2) at full text fol-
   lowing a published protocol. All case studies included were coded using a standard questionnaire. A narrative synthe-
   sis approach was used to identify trends in the evidence, knowledge gaps, and knowledge clusters.
   Results: A total of 62 articles that spanned 71 Canadian case studies were included in the systematic map. Stud-
   ies across the coastal and marine regions of Inuit Nunangat accounted for the majority of the studies. Whether the
   focus is on management and decision making or research and monitoring, the predominant ecological scale was at
   the species level, accounting for over two-thirds of the included studies. There were 24 distinct coastal and marine
   species of central focus across the studies. Nunavut had the greatest taxonomic coverage as studies conducted to
   date cover 13 different genera. The predominant methodology employed for combining and/or including Indigenous
   knowledge was case study design, which accounted for over half of the studies. Other methodologies employed
   for combining and/or including different ways of knowing included: (i) community-based participatory research; (ii)
   mixed methods; (iii) ethnography; and (iv) simulation modelling. There are a suite of methods utilized for document-
   ing and translating Indigenous knowledge and an equally diverse tool box of methods used in the collection of scien-
   tific data. Over half of the case studies involved Indigenous knowledge systems of the Inuit, while another significant
   proportion involved Indigenous knowledge systems of First Nations, reflecting 21 unique nations. We found that
   demographics of knowledge holders were generally not reported in the articles reviewed.
   Conclusions: The results of this systematic map provide key insights to inform and improve future research. First,
   a variety of methodologies and methods are used in these types of studies. Therefore, there is a need to consider
   in more detail how Indigenous and science-based knowledge systems can be respectively bridged across subjects
