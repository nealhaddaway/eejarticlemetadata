   Abstract
   Background: The concept of Nature-based Solutions (NBS) has evolved as an umbrella concept embracing concepts
   such as Green/Blue/Nature Infrastructure, Ecosystem Approach, Ecosystem Services, but at their core, they cluster into
   the general theme of learning from and using nature to create sustainable socio-ecological systems, which enhance
   human well-being (HWB). NBS address societal challenges across a broad range of spatial scales—local, regional and
   global—and temporal scales—medium to long-term. While there are many reviews and a clear evidence base linking
   certain NBS to various elements of HWB, particularly urban greenspace and human health, no comprehensive map‑
   ping exists of the links between NBS interventions and the associated multiple positive and negative HWB outcomes
   across a range of habitats. The initial research phase used a participatory co-design process to select four priority
   societal challenges facing the United Kingdom: three related to management issues i.e. NBS cost-efficacy, governance
   in planning, environmental justice, and the fourth threats to the acoustic environment. These challenges collectively
   address priority management issues which stakeholders requested be investigated widely i.e. across landscapes, city‑
   scapes, seascapes and soundscapes. Results of the study are intended to identify and define potential future environ‑
   mental evidence challenges for UK science.
   Methods: This protocol describes the methodology for approaching the research question: What evidence is there
   for nature based solutions and their impacts on human wellbeing for societal challenges related to cost-efficacy,
   governance in planning, environmental justice, and the acoustic environment? Using systematic mapping, this study
   will search for and identify studies that seek to assess nature-based solutions on human well-being with regard to
   these four societal challenges. Systematic searches across a number of academic/online databases are tested against
   a number of test articles. Search results are refined using eligibility criteria through a three stage process: title, abstract,
   full text. Data from screened studies are extracted using a predefined coding strategy. Key trends in data will be syn‑
   thesized according to a range of secondary questions and be presented in a graphical matrix illustrating the knowl‑
   edge gaps and clusters for research into nature-based solutions and human well-being for each societal challenge.

Background
Approaching the turn of the millennium, an increasing
number of individuals and organisations started to pro-
mote an anthropocentric view of the management of nat-
ural resources [1]. The thinking led to the realisation that
humans and nature cannot be treated separately and has
continued to resonate (for example see [2, 3]). Research
and policy began to focus on the benefits that nature may
provide for humans [4–6] and many theoretical and prac-
tical approaches developed. The concept of nature-based
solutions (NBS) evolved as an umbrella concept embrac-
ing concepts such as Green/Blue/Nature Infrastructure,
Ecosystem Approach, Ecosystem Services, Natural Capi-
tal, Ecosystem-based Adaptation//Mitigation, Ecological         Fig. 1 The central role of nature-based solutions is to mediate the
