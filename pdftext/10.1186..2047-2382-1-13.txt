  Abstract
  Background: Ecosystem-based approaches for adaptation (EbA) integrate the use of biodiversity and ecosystem
  services into an overall strategy for helping people adapt to climate change. To date, insight into these approaches
  has often been based on reports from isolated anecdotal case studies. Although these are informative, and provide
  evidence that people are using ecosystems to adapt, they provide rather limited insight in terms of measuring and
  evaluating the effectiveness of EbA, especially when compared with technical or structural adaptation interventions.
  The body of scientific evidence indicating how effective such approaches are is lacking in some aspects. Where
  evidence does exist it is often dispersed across a range of related fields, such as natural resource management,
  disaster risk reduction and agroecology. To date, there has been little attempt to systematically assemble and
  analyse this evidence. Therefore, the current state of evidence regarding the merits or otherwise of EbA is unknown
  and it has not been possible to identify prevailing knowledge gaps to inform research and analysis, which will
  enable policymakers to compare EbA with other adaptation options.
  Methods: This protocol details the methodology to be used to conduct a systematic map of peer-reviewed
  published journal papers and a limited selection of grey literature, to give a methodical overview of the state of the
  evidence base for EbA effectiveness, and to identify the current knowledge gaps. It addresses the following
  question: What is the state of the evidence base regarding the ability of ecosystem-based approaches for
  adaptation to help people adapt to the impacts of climate change?
  Keywords: Climate change, Adaptation, Ecosystem management, Conservation, Biodiversity, Ecosystem services,
