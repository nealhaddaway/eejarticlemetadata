   Abstract
   Background: Many infectious pathogens can be transmitted from animals to humans and vice versa, or by animals
   (especially arthropods) to humans. Such diseases are called zoonotic and/or vector-borne diseases. To control or
   prevent them, it is often recommended to target population reduction of host or vector species, through preventive
   culling or insecticide use for example. But these types of destructive interventions have shown several limits altering
   their efficiency, including acquired resistance of arthropods to insecticides, unpredicted change in the ecology of
   host populations, unexpected negative functional consequences on ecosystems, as well as economic embrittlement
   when livestock is concerned. An alternative pathway of action would be to rely on the functioning of ecosystems, and
   on their careful management, to regulate diseases and thus reduce their impact on human health. In this perspec‑
   tive, a thorough evaluation of the conditions that can potentially promote such a positive regulation of infectious
   pathogens by ecosystems, and their efficiency, is needed. Here, we present the protocol of a systematic review that
   will evaluate the scientific evidence existing on potential links between ecosystem components or functions and 14
   vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health.
   Methods: We will search for studies that tested the effect of changes in (i) biological communities, and (ii) habitats
   and landscapes, on diseases. Scientific literature from 5 publication databases will be screened in a 3-rounds pro‑
   cess: title, abstract and full-text screening. At each stage, articles will be either rejected or kept for the next round,
   depending on whether they fall in the exclusion or inclusion criteria. We will present results in two parts: a systematic
   map and a systematic review. The systematic map will present, for the 14 diseases, the number of publications, their
   geographical distribution, the type of ecosystem component/function they studied, as well as the host(s) in which
   epidemiological measurements have been performed. From this systematic map, we will identify groups of articles
   that allow for critical appraisal, i.e. groups of articles that studied the effect of the same ecosystem component/func‑
   tion on the same disease. Only those articles will be included in the systematic review. The validity of these articles will
   be assessed by critical appraisal and presented as a narrative synthesis with confidence levels.
