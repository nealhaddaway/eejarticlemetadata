   Abstract
   Sharp et al. [1] raise a number of concerns about the development and communication of ROSES (RepOrting stand-
   ards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses), and we welcome the opportunity to explain some of the underlying thinking
   behind development of the reporting standards for environmental evidence syntheses.
We acknowledge that development of ROSES diverged                                             a broader community which has as yet limited experience
