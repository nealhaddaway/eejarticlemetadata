Engaging environmental policyâ€‘makers
with systematic reviews: challenges, solutions
and lessons learned
Alexandra M. Collins1* , Deborah Coughlin1 and Nicola Randall2
   Abstract
   The creation and accumulation of robust bodies of knowledge, along with their dissemination, utilisation and inte-
   gration in decision support are key to improving the use of evidence in decision-making. Systematic reviews (SRs),
   through their emphasis on transparency, replicability and rigour, offer numerous benefits throughout the policy-mak-
   ing cycle and for improving the use of evidence in environmental policy-making. As a result there have been numer-
   ous calls to increase the use of SRs in environmental policy-making. This commentary paper introduces the chal-
   lenges of engaging policy-makers with SRs and, using experiences of producing SRs with Government Departments
   and Agencies within the UK and Europe, identifies possible solutions and shares our lessons learned. It highlights that
   co-production can help to overcome a number of challenges by ensuring that review questions are policy-relevant,
   that the context of the review is taken into consideration and that reviewâ€™s findings are communicated so that they
   are recognised and used in policy decision-making processes. Additionally, a pragmatic approach to the reviewâ€™s
   methodology may be required to respond to policy-making requirements. Here, a risk-based approach can com-
   municate the trade-offs between the rigour and timeliness of the review. Ensuring that systematic approaches are
   upheld at all times can help address impartiality concerns and can develop skills in both reviewers and policy-makers
   to increase awareness of systematic methods, leading to changes in practice and culture within decision-making
   organisations and the promotion of evidence informed policy development and decisions.
