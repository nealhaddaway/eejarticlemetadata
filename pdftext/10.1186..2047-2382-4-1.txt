A systematic mapping protocol: what are the
impacts of different upstream business models in
the agriculture and forestry sector on sustainable
development in tropical developing countries?

  Abstract
  Background: As a result of rising global food and energy insecurity, investors are increasingly seeking new
  opportunities in tropical developing countries endowed with comparatively cheap and abundant land resources.
  Predominantly targeting the agriculture and forestry sectors, these investments could make valuable contributions
  to the economies of developing countries. However, with most investors opting for plantation-oriented business
  models, in the context of weak governance regimes within many host countries, many fear that these investments
  may instead exacerbate socio-economic vulnerabilities and processes of environmental degradation. Therefore,
  there is a need to explore alternative upstream business models that are more inclusive of the poor and are more
  aligned with emergent green growth objectives. This systematic map aims to contribute to this debate by cataloging
  empirical studies conducted on the sustainability of different upstream business models in the agriculture and forestry
  sector (e.g. involving the cultivation of raw materials). The mapping will offer an overview of the type and quantity of
  research conducted to date, remaining knowledge gaps, and areas warranting a systematic review.
  Methods: Searches will be conducted of both academic and grey literature by employing search strings that have been
  iteratively tested for comprehensiveness. Studies retrieved in the searches will be screened using pre-defined inclusion
  criteria and coded across a broad range of study characteristics. Inclusion criteria include, for example, type of business
  model employed, social, economic, and environmental impacts, and study design (e.g. generation of new empirical
  evidence). The outputs will be a database of included search results and a systematic map offering descriptive statistics
  and narrative assessment of the state of the evidence base in this topic.
