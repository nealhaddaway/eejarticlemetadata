Socioeconomic and environmental effects of
China’s Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program
after 15 years: a systematic review protocol
Lucas Gutiérrez Rodríguez1*, Nick Hogarth1, Wen Zhou1, Louis Putzel1, Chen Xie2 and Kun Zhang2
  Abstract
  Background: Agricultural activities on sloping lands have historically led to forest loss and degradation in China
  which, coupled with industrial pressures on the environment, were deemed responsible for catastrophic flooding
  events in the late 1990s. After these events, China’s forest policy underwent a significant reorientation towards
  ecological conservation and rural development, a process epitomized by the Conversion of Cropland to Forest
  Program (CCFP). Launched in 1999, the CCFP integrates both socioeconomic and environmental objectives with the
  aim of reforesting smallholder cropland on sloping lands, while compensating farmers with payments for their lost
  income. Following 15 years of implementation, it is timely to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the state of
  knowledge about the CCFP’s impacts on human populations and the environment.
  Methods/design: The primary research question asks “What socioeconomic and environmental effects has the
  Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program had on human populations and land resources during its first 15 years in
  China?” We use a theory of change and a Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome (PICO) framework to structure
  our systematic review, where populations of interest consist of both human populations and land resources targeted
  by the program, while the intervention of interest is the CCFP as defined by its component activities, including
  compensatory subsidies, skill-training, and enforcement with field checks. Outcomes are defined as both the
  socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the program. We will conduct a search for relevant English and
  Chinese language literature on Scopus, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, AGRIS (FAO), and the China National
  Knowledge Infrastructure. Search results will be screened for relevance in a two stage process (titles and abstracts,
  followed by full texts) based on predefined eligibility criteria, and then further assessed for potential sources of
  bias. Extraction of data from those studies that have passed full-text screening will follow a coding protocol
  based on the PICO framework, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of the extracted data will be conducted
  and synthesized. Finally, a narrative report will present the findings of the review, alongside a geographic map
  illustrating the coverage of included studies compared with the actual implementation area of the CCFP.
