   Abstract
   Background: The translocation of plants or animals between populations has been used in conservation to
   reinforce populations of threatened species, and may be used in the future to buffer species’ ranges from the
   anticipated effects of environmental change. This population admixture can result in outbreeding, and the resulting
   “hybrid” offspring can be either fitter (heterosis) or less fit (outbreeding depression) than their parents. Outbreeding
   depression has the potential to undermine conservation plans that mix populations of declining or threatened
   species.
   Methods: We searched for literature documenting phenotypic responses to intraspecific outbreeding between
   natural populations of animal and plant species. Outbreeding responses were summarised as log-response ratios
   that compared hybrid with mid-parent phenotypes (528 effect sizes from 98 studies). These data included effect
   sizes from both fitness components (survival, viability and fecundity traits) and other traits (e.g. morphological,
   physiological, defence), and were pooled using Bayesian mixed-effects meta-analysis.
   Results: There was no overall effect of outbreeding on hybrid phenotypes (overall pooled effect = +2.61%
   phenotypic change relative to parents, 95% credible interval (CI) −1.03–6.60%). However, fitness component traits
   responded significantly more negatively to outbreeding than traits less directly linked with fitness. Our model
   predicted a significant 6.9% F1 generation benefit to outcrossing through non-fitness traits (CI 2.7–11.2%), but no
   significant benefit to these traits in the F2 (3.5%; CI −4.3–12.2%). Fitness component traits were predicted to suffer a
   cost (−8.8%) relative to parents in the F2 (CI −14.1– − 2.5%), but not in the F1 (+1.3%; CI −2.1–5.4%). Between-study
   variation accounted for 39.5% of heterogeneity in outbreeding responses, leaving 27.1% of heterogeneity between
   effect sizes within studies and 33.4% attributable to measurement error within effect sizes.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates consistent effects of trait type on responses to intraspecific outbreeding, and
   indicates the potential for outbreeding depression in the F2. However, our analyses also reveal significant
   heterogeneity in outbreeding responses within and among studies. Thus, outbreeding costs will not always occur.
   Conservation practitioners may be able to anticipate when such outbreeding depression should arise using an
   existing decision-making framework that takes into account the context of hybridising populations.

DIC (column two) gives the deviance information criterion. “Vs. DIC” gives the DIC for the corresponding model including only an intercept term. “Δ DIC” gives the
difference in DIC between columns two and three. Range in DIC gives the range in DIC among three replicate model runs, as an indication of the extent of Monte
Carlo error in DIC estimates. Study and residual variance components are variance estimates for study and residual random effects. “Min. effective samples” gives
the minimum number of effective samples for the parameters in the model. “Max. auto-correlation” gives the maximum absolute sample autocorrelation at lag 1
