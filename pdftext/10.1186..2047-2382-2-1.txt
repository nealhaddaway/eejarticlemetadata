How effective are reedbeds, ponds, restored and
constructed wetlands at retaining nitrogen,
phosphorus and suspended sediment from
agricultural pollution in England?

  Abstract
  A high priority topic within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) water quality
  programme is the mitigation of diffuse rural pollution from agriculture. Wetlands are often cited as being effective
  at reducing nutrient and sediment loadings to receiving waters. However, the research in this area is inconsistent,
  and whilst most studies have shown that both natural and constructed wetlands retain nutrients and sediments,
  others have shown that they have little effect, or even increase nutrient and sediment loads to receiving water
  bodies. DEFRA has commissioned a systematic review on the use of wetlands to mitigate N, P and SS inputs from
  agriculture to receiving freshwater in England. The review will encompass a comprehensive literature search on all
  available material on the subject, both published and unpublished within the British Isles. Specific inclusion criteria
  will be adhered to and a formal assessment of the quality and reliability of the studies will be undertaken. The data
  will then be extracted and a data synthesis undertaken. The review will inform an evidence-based policy that can
  be implemented by stakeholders.
