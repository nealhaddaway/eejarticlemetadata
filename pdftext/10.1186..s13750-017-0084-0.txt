  Abstract
  Background: Mesocosm experiments have become increasingly popular in climate change research as they bridge
  the gap between small-scale, less realistic, microcosm experiments, and large-scale, more complex, natural systems.
  Characteristics of aquatic mesocosm designs (e.g., mesocosm volume, study duration, and replication) vary widely,
  potentially affecting the magnitude and direction of effect sizes measured in experiments. In this global systematic
  review we aim to identify the type, direction and strength of climate warming effects on aquatic species, communi‑
  ties and ecosystems in mesocosm experiments. Furthermore, we will investigate the context-dependency of the
  observed effects on several a priori determined effect moderators (ecological and methodological). Our conclusions
  will provide recommendations for aquatic scientists designing mesocosm experiments, as well as guidelines for inter‑
  pretation of experimental results by scientists, policy-makers and the general public.
  Methods: We will conduct a systematic search using multiple online databases to gather evidence from the scien‑
  tific literature on the effects of warming experimentally tested in aquatic mesocosms. Data from relevant studies will
  be extracted and used in a random effects meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect sizes of warming experiments
  on species performance, biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Experimental characteristics (e.g., mesocosm size and
  shape, replication-level, experimental duration and design, biogeographic region, community type, crossed manipu‑
  lation) will be further analysed using subgroup analyses.
