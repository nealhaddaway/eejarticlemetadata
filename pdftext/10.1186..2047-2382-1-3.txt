What are the effects of wooded riparian zones on
stream temperature?
Diana E Bowler1*, Rebecca Mant1, Harriet Orr2, David M Hannah3 and Andrew S Pullin1
  Abstract
  Background: Predicted increases in stream temperature due to climate change will have a number of direct and
  indirect impacts on stream biota. A potential intervention for mitigating stream temperature rise is the use of
  wooded riparian zones to increase shade and reduce direct warming through solar radiation. To assess the
  effectiveness of this intervention, we conducted a systematic review of the available evidence for the effects of
  wooded riparian zones on stream temperature.
  Methods: We searched literature databases and conducted relevant web searches. Inclusion criteria were: subject -
  any stream in a temperate climate; intervention - presence of trees in the riparian zone; comparator - absence of
  trees in the riparian zone; outcome measure - stream temperature. Included studies were sorted into 3 groups
  based on the scale of the intervention and design of the study. Two groups were taken forward for synthesis;
  Group 1 studies comparing water temperature in streams with and without buffer strips/riparian cover and Group 2
  comparisons of stream temperatures in open and forested landscapes. Temperature data were extracted and
  quantitative synthesis performed using a random effects meta-analysis on the differences in mean and maximum
  temperature.
  Results: Ten studies were included in each of Groups 1 and 2. Results for both groups suggest that riparian
  wooded zones lower spring and summer stream temperatures. Lowering of maximum is greater than lowering of
  mean temperature. Further analysis of environmental variables that might modify the effects of the intervention
  was not possible using the limited set of studies.
  Conclusions: Wooded riparian zones can reduce stream temperatures, particularly in terms of maximum
  temperatures. Because temperature is known to affect fish, amphibian and invertebrate life history, the reported
  effect sizes are likely to have a biological significance for the stream biotic community. Consequently investment in
  creation of wooded riparian zones might provide benefits in terms of mitigating some of the ecological effects of
  climate change on water temperature. Considerable uncertainty lies in the environmental variables that may modify
  the cooling effect of wooded riparian zones, and therefore it is not possible to identify when the use of this
  intervention for cooling would be most valuable.
