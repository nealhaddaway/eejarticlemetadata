Are alternative livelihood projects
effective at reducing local threats to specified

maintaining the conservation status of those
elements?

   Abstract
   Background: Alternative livelihood projects are used by a variety of organisations as a tool for achieving biodiver‑
   sity conservation. However, despite characterising many conservation approaches, very little is known about what
   impacts (if any) alternative livelihood projects have had on biodiversity conservation, as well as what determines
   the relative success or failure of these interventions. Reflecting this concern, Motion 145 was passed at the Vth IUCN
   World Conservation Congress in 2012 calling for a critical review of alternative livelihood projects and their contribu‑
   tion to biodiversity conservation. This systematic map and review intends to contribute to this critical review and
   provide an overview for researchers, policy makers and practitioners of the current state of the evidence base.
   Methods: Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches for relevant studies were conducted using the bib‑
   liographic databases AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Abstracts, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge, as well as internet searches
   of Google, Google Scholar, and subject specific and institutional websites. In addition, a call for literature was issued
   among relevant research networks. The titles, abstracts and full texts of the captured studies were assessed using
   inclusion criteria for the systematic map and the systematic review, respectively. An Excel spreadsheet was used to
   record data from each study and to provide a systematic map of the evidence for the effectiveness of alternative liveli‑
   hood studies. The studies that met additional criteria to be included in the systematic review were described in more
   detail through a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Following full text screening, 97 studies were included in the systematic map covering 106 projects using
   alternative livelihood interventions. Just 22 of these projects met our additional criteria for inclusion in the systematic
   review, but one project was removed from the detailed narrative synthesis following critical appraisal. The 21 included
   projects included reports of positive, neutral and negative conservation outcomes.
   Conclusions: Our results show that there has been an extensive investment in alternative livelihood projects, yet the
   structure and results of most of these projects have not been documented in a way that they can be captured using
   standardised search processes. Either this is because there has been little reporting on the outcomes of these projects,
