   Abstract
   Background: Fish injury and mortality resulting from entrainment and/or impingement during downstream passage
   over/through hydropower infrastructure has the potential to cause negative effects on fish populations. The primary
   goal of this systematic review was to address two research questions: (1) What are the consequences of hydroelectric
   dam fish entrainment and impingement on freshwater fish productivity in temperate regions?; (2) To what extent
   do various factors like site type, intervention type, and life history characteristics influence the consequences of fish
   entrainment and impingement?
   Methods: The review was conducted using guidelines provided by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence
   and examined commercially published and grey literature. All articles found using a systematic search were screened
   using a priori eligibility criteria at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text, respectively), with consistency checks
   being performed at each stage. The validity of studies was appraised and data were extracted using tools explicitly
   designed for this review. A narrative synthesis encompassed all relevant studies and a quantitative synthesis (meta-
   analysis) was conducted where appropriate.
   Review findings: A total of 264 studies from 87 articles were included for critical appraisal and narrative synthesis.
   Studies were primarily conducted in the United States (93%) on genera in the Salmonidae family (86%). The evidence
   base did not allow for an evaluation of the consequences of entrainment/impingement on fish productivity per
   se; therefore, we evaluated the risk of freshwater fish injury and mortality owing to downstream passage through
   common hydropower infrastructure. Our quantitative synthesis suggested an overall increased risk of injury and
   immediate mortality from passage through/over hydropower infrastructure. Injury and immediate mortality risk
   varied among infrastructure types. Bypasses resulted in decreased injury risk relative to controls, whereas turbines and
   spillways were associated with the highest injury risks relative to controls. Within turbine studies, those conducted in
   a lab setting were associated with higher injury risk than field-based studies, and studies with longer assessment time

  periods (≥ 24–48 h) were associated with higher risk than shorter duration assessment periods (< 24 h). Turbines and
  sluiceways were associated with the highest immediate mortality risk relative to controls. Within turbine studies, lab-
  based studies had higher mortality risk ratios than field-based studies. Within field studies, Francis turbines resulted
  in a higher immediate mortality risk than Kaplan turbines relative to controls, and wild sourced fish had a higher
  immediate mortality risk than hatchery sourced fish in Kaplan turbines. No other associations between effect size and
  moderators were identified. Taxonomic analyses revealed a significant increased injury and immediate mortality risk
  relative to controls for genera Alosa (river herring) and Oncorhynchus (Pacific salmonids), and delayed mortality risk for
  Anguilla (freshwater eels).
  Conclusions: Our synthesis suggests that hydropower infrastructure in temperate regions increased the overall risk
  of freshwater fish injury and immediate mortality relative to controls. The evidence base confirmed that turbines and
  spillways increase the risk of injury and/or mortality for downstream passing fish compared to controls. Differences
  in lab- and field-based studies were evident, highlighting the need for further studies to understand the sources of
  variation among lab- and field-based studies. We were unable to examine delayed mortality, likely due to the lack of
  consistency in monitoring for post-passage delayed injury and mortality. Our synthesis suggests that bypasses are the
  most “fish friendly” passage option in terms of reducing fish injury and mortality. To address knowledge gaps, studies
  are needed that focus on systems outside of North America, on non-salmonid or non-sportfish target species, and on
  population-level consequences of fish entrainment/impingement.

Term                       Description
Interventions
  Bypass                   A structure that collects fish upstream and deposits fish downstream of the facility. Typically used for juveniles. Several bypass
                             types, but surface and turbine bypasses are most common
  Dam                      Structure for impounding water. Dam height generates head pressure for the turbines
  Draft tube               A column (structure) from the turbine outlet to the tailrace that water flows through
  Exclusionary device      Structure(s) to prevent or divert fish entrance/passage. Often used to divert fish from turbines into bypasses. Common struc-
                             tures include various screens
  General infrastructure Category used to capture studies that evaluated entrainment or impingement through > 1 components of a hydroelectric
                             facility. Within the meta-analysis, this category encompassed lab studies that simulate conditions fish may experience (e.g.,
                             shear forces) through various infrastructure
  Louver                   A structure of set angled bars or slats that can be used to divert/guide fish towards bypasses or sluices. These structures do
                             not exclude fish like screens, rather alter hydraulic flow patterns and/or streamflow to guide fish
  Outlet works             A combination of structures designed to control reservoir water levels and/or water release for hydropower facility operations.
                             Structures can include intake towers, outlet tunnels and/or conduits, control gates, and discharge channels. Intake structures
                             can have trash racks or other purposefully designed fish intakes
  Penstock                 An intake structure (channel, pipe) that leads into the turbines
  Screen                   An exclusionary device to prevent fish from entering a structure (e.g., turbine) or divert fish towards a bypass
  Spillway                 An outlet or channel in a dam or reservoir that discharges surplus water downstream of a dam. Spillways can vary by design
                             (e.g., channel type, height)
  Sluiceways               A surface channel extending from the forebay to the tailrace designed to allow ice and debris to pass
  Surface bypasses         Structures that spill minimal amounts of water to facilitate passage over a dam. Several types exist (see [23]). Fish are collected
                             and pass through a series channels that discharges downstream of the facility into the tailrace. Typically used for juvenile
                             salmonids, taking advantage of their surface-oriented swimming behaviour
  Trash rack               A type of exclusionary device designed to keep debris out of turbine intakes, but can be used to guide fish to “safer” passage
                             routes such as bypasses and sluices
  Turbine (hydraulic)      A structure that converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy. There are several turbine types with different
                             configurations, the most common are Francis and Kaplan (see definitions below)
  Kaplan turbine           An “axial”, vertical, propeller-like turbine used for lower pressure heads (less than 100 m). Smaller in overall size (relative to
                             Francis), typically has 4 to 8 adjustable blades and a specific running speed ranging 250 to 850 rpm
  Francis turbine          A “radial” turbine used for higher pressure heads (100 to 500 m). Larger in overall size (relative to Kaplan), typically has 16 to 24
                             fixed blades and a specific running speed of 50 to 250 rpm
  Turbine bypass           A structure that fish can enter from the gatewell, bypasses the turbines and powerhouse through a series of channels, and
                             discharges downstream into the tailrace. Typically used for juvenile salmonids
Fish injuries/impacts
  Abrasion                 Damage to skin and/or scales
  Blade strike             Turbine blade striking a fish. Can result in injuries/mortality from grinding (depending on blade spacing, small fish more prone
                             to this), bruising, and cuts of varying severity (superficial, mortal wounding)
  Barotrauma               Damage caused from exposure to rapid changes in barometric pressure, typically during turbine passage. The most common
                             injuries/mortalities are related to swim bladder ruptures. In the presence of high total dissolved gasses, rapid pressure
                             changes can cause gas embolisms in tissues/organs and other symptoms of gas bubble disease
  Descaling                Scale loss. Often expressed as a percentage of the scale loss on the whole fish (e.g., 20% scale loss)
  Entrainment              When fish (non-) volitionally pass through hydropower infrastructure
  Hemorrhage               Bleeding, blood loss
  Impingement              When a fish becomes pinned/trapped against an infrastructure
  Cavitation               Formation of gas bubbles in water, which when collapsed generate a pressure wave that can cause ill effects for fish in close
                             proximity
  Mechanical effects       Damage (injury/mortality) caused from fish physically interacting with structures (e.g., blade strike)
  Pressure effects         Rapid changes in pressure (perpendicular to surface, dorsoventral) during passage that can cause fish damage
  Shear effects            Rapid changes in pressure (parallel to surface, anteroposterior) during passage that can cause fish damage
  Turbulence effects       Damage (injury/mortality) to fish caused by turbulent water (irregular movement of water)
General terms

Study        If at a given site, evaluations of responses were conducted for different: (1) operational conditions (e.g., turbine discharge, wicket gate

                different interventions (e.g., mortality at turbines and at spillways), we only considered these separate studies if the fish were released
                separately for each intervention (i.e., different release points immediately above the intervention under evaluation, within the same or
                different years). When studies released a group of fish at a single location above all interventions, and the outcomes came from route-

Effects of moderators on Immediate fish mortality
To address the question, to what extent does interven-
tion type influence the impact of fish entrainment and
impingement, there were only sufficient sample sizes
(i.e., > 2 data sets from ≥ 2 sites) to include the following
interventions for immediate mortality: (1) Turbines; (2)
General infrastructure; (3) Bypasses; (4) Spillways, and
(5) Sluiceways (Fig. 9).
   Intervention type was associated with pooled risk
ratios for immediate fish mortality (Table 9A), with gen-
eral infrastructure, turbines, and sluiceways associated
with higher risk ratios than spillways and water bypasses
(371%, 283%, and 261% increase vs. 101 and 11% increase,
respectively) (Figs. 9 and 13, and Table 7B).
Turbines There were only sufficient sample sizes to per-
mit meaningful tests of the influence of the following fac-
tors: (1) Site type; (2) Source; (3) Life stage; and (4) Sam-
pling method. Due to uneven distributions between fish
source and sampling method categories, the influence of
fish source and sampling method on effect size was inves-
tigated within the subset of field-based studies only (see                  Fig. 13 Weighted pooled risk ratios by interventions for immediate
