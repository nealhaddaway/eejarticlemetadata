What are the impacts of small‑scale

   Abstract
   Background: Small-scale dredging activities in freshwater bodies have the potential to impact habitats and food
   resources that fishes depend on, and ultimately impact fisheries productivity. This systematic review will explore the
   evidence base for small-scale dredging impacts on the indicators of fisheries productivity, and will help to inform
   management decisions that seek to reconcile biodiversity conservation and freshwater fisheries, with potentially
   disruptive anthropogenic activities in freshwater environments.
   Methods: This systematic review will examine, summarize and synthesize all available evidence on the impacts of
   small-scale dredging activities on surrogate indicators of fisheries productivity. All studies in freshwater habitats in
   temperate regions in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres will be considered. Both peer reviewed primary
   and grey literature will be included in the review, and searches will be conducted in academic journal databases,
   online search engines, and specialist websites. Study validity will be critically assessed to identify any risk of bias. Data
   will be presented as a narrative synthesis, and if sufficient good quality data are available, a meta-analysis will be
   performed.

activities [15, 18, 19]. Biodiversity conservation is fre-
quently at odds with other ecosystem services required
and anthropogenic uses of freshwater, leading to con-
flicting management priorities. Effective management
requires the identification and reconciliation of trade-offs
between biodiversity or fisheries productivity and human
uses in freshwater systems [20, 21], to provide transpar-
ent, defensible evidence-based decisions. To this end, the
rigorous methodology employed by systematic reviews
and related meta-analyses make them a valuable tool in
making informed fisheries management decisions [22].
