  Abstract
  Background: The role of linear transportation infrastructures (roads, railways, oil and gas pipelines, power lines, rivers
  and canals) in fragmenting natural habitats is fully acknowledged. Up to now, the potential of linear transportation
  infrastructures verges (road and railway embankments, strips of grass under power lines or above buried pipelines,
  or waterway banks) as habitat or corridor for biodiversity, remains controversial. In a context of decreasing natural
  habitats, the opportunities of anthropogenic areas for contributing to wildlife conservation have to be considered.
  The present paper is the first synthesis of evidence about the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as
  corridor and/or habitat for insects in temperate landscapes.
  Methods: A systematic literature survey was made using two online publication databases, a search engine and by
  sending a call for literature to subject experts. Identified articles were successively screened for relevance on titles,
  abstracts and full texts using criteria detailed in an a priori protocol. We then used six specific questions to categorize
  and to critically appraise the retained studies. These questions encompassed the potential of verges as habitats and
  corridors for insects, and the effects of management and landscape context on these potentialities. A user-friendly
  database was created to sort the studies with low and medium susceptibility to bias. We used these studies to synthe-
  size results of each specific question in a narrative synthesis. Finally, studies that met the meta-analysis requirements
  were used for a quantitative synthesis.
  Results: Our searches identified 64,206 articles. After critical appraisal, 91 articles that reported 104 studies were
  included in our review. Almost all of them had “control-impact” design, only two studies used “before-after-control-
  impact” design, and one study used “before-after” design. In some cases, artificialization of transportation infrastruc-
  tures lowered insect biodiversity while vegetation restoration had a moderate positive effect; the trend remained
  unclear for mowing/grazing practices. Urbanization and agriculture in the surroundings tended to lower the biodi-
  versity hosted by verges, while natural and forested areas tended to promote it. No study dealt with the influence
  of management or surrounding landscape on insect dispersal along the verge. The small number of studies that
  compared the dispersal along verges and in habitats away from transportation infrastructures, together with the

   inconsistencies of their results, prevented us from drawing conclusions. Meta-analyses were performed on 709 cases
   from 34 primary studies that compared biodiversity in verges vs. other habitats. Overall insect species richness did not
   differ between LTI verges and compared habitats. Globally, insect abundance seemed higher on LTI verges than in
   compared habitats, a result driven by the higher abundance of pollinators and primary consumers on non-highway
   road verges than in habitats away from roads.
   Conclusions: A major knowledge gap regarding the potential of linear transportation infrastructure verges as cor-
   ridors for insects has been identified. Thus, we encourage more research on this topic. Infrastructure practitioners
   could benefit from our results about linear transportation infrastructure verges as habitat for certain taxa and about
   the impact of their management practices on insect abundance and species richness.

with enough data), and (2) the interaction between habi-
tat specialization and LTI type for the subset of data on
pollinators (the only trophic level with enough data). The
“forest specialist” category was discarded as it only gath-
ered five cases. Given the absence of statistically signifi-
cant interaction in both cases (the AIC of the model with
interaction was not lower by 2 points or more than the
AIC of the model without interaction), the “habitat spe-
cialization” factor was not taken into account in further
meta-analyses. We pooled all species irrespective of their
habitat specialization for subsequent analyses.
   We evaluated the effect of the trophic level on the
abundance of insects for each LTI type separately (see
Fig. 7). Despite the large number of cases for abundance
(N = 661), their distribution between moderator catego-
ries prevented us to run a model using the conservation
status of each species as moderator (N pest/invasive = 2,
see Additional file 7). In a last step, we checked if contrast
between verges and compared habitats did not affect our
results by testing the interaction between habitat contrast
(low/medium vs. high) and trophic level for the subset of
data on highways (the only LTI with enough data).
   For species richness, the uneven distribution of effect
sizes and their small number (N = 48) prevented us to
evaluate the effect of trophic level. We were thus unable
to move further beyond evaluating the effect of LTI type.
   For all data analyses, total heterogeneity, Q­ T, was par-
titioned into heterogeneity explained by the model, ­QM,
and heterogeneity not explained by the model, Q        ­ E (i.e.
­QT = QM + QE). The statistical significance of Q ­ M and ­QE
were tested against a χ2 distribution.
   Because some case studies may not be fully independ-
ent as they came from the same primary study, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of
the main results (Additional file 9).
   Meta-analyses were conducted in R 3.3.2 [45] using the
metafor R package [71].
