The fitness consequences of inbreeding in natural
populations and their implications for species
conservation – a systematic map

  Abstract
  Background: Threatened species often have small and isolated populations where mating among relatives can
  result in inbreeding depression increasing extinction risk. Effective management is hampered by a lack of syntheses
  summarising the magnitude of, and variation in inbreeding depression. Here we describe the nature and scope
  of the literature examining phenotypic/fitness consequences of inbreeding, to provide a foundation for future
  syntheses and management.
  Methods: We searched the literature for articles documenting the impact of inbreeding in natural populations.
  Article titles, abstracts and full-texts were assessed against a priori defined criteria, and information relating to study
  design, quality and other factors that may influence inbreeding responses (e.g. population size) was extracted from
  relevant articles.
  Results: The searches identified 11457 articles, of which 614 were assessed as relevant and included in the systematic
  map (corresponding to 703 distinct studies). Most studies (663) assessed within-population inbreeding resulting from
  self-fertilisation or consanguineous pairings, while 118 studies assessed among-population inbreeding due to drift load.
  Plants were the most studied taxon (469 studies) followed by insects (52 studies) and birds (43 studies). Most studies
  investigated the effects of inbreeding on components of fitness (e.g. survival or fecundity; 648 studies) but measurements
  were typically under laboratory/greenhouse conditions (486 studies). Observations were also often restricted to the first
  inbred generation (607 studies) and studies frequently lacked contextual information (e.g. population size).
  Conclusions: Our systematic map describes the scope and quality of the evidence describing the phenotypic
  consequences of inbreeding. The map reveals substantial evidence relating to inbreeding responses exists,
  but highlights information is still limited for some aspects, including the effects of multiple generations of
  inbreeding. The systematic map allowed us to define several conservation-relevant questions, where sufficient
  data exists to support systematic reviews, e.g. How do inbreeding responses vary with population size? However,
  we found that such syntheses are likely to be constrained by incomplete reporting of critical contextual information.
  Our systematic map employed the same rigorous literature assessment methods as systematic review, including a
  novel survey of study quality and thus provides a robust foundation to guide future research and syntheses seeking to
  inform conservation decision-making.

assessment
Objectivity of article assessment was determined using the Kappa coefficient of agreement via independent assessments of a subset of articles [29]. Articles were
assessed by three reviewers (RW, JE and LEN).
*79 articles could not be assessed and were excluded at this stage due to being written in a language other than English or required additional information from
the authors before inclusion due to insufficient/unclear reporting.
