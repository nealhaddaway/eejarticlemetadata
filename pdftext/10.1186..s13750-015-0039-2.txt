  Abstract
  Background: In the fields of environmental governance and biodiversity conservation, there is a growing
  awareness that gender has an influence on resource use and management. Several studies argue that empowering
  women in resource governance can lead to beneficial outcomes for resource sustainability and biodiversity
  conservation. Yet how robust is the evidence to support this claim? Here we focus on the forestry and fisheries
  sectors to answer the primary question: What is the evidence that the gender composition of forest and fishery
  management groups affects resource governance and conservation outcomes? Our objective is to produce a
  systematic map of the evidence highlighting, inter alia, the geographic distribution and quality of the evidence, the
  consistency and robustness of the findings, and where further research is needed.
  Methods/design: This protocol provides the details of the methodology. The search terms used to identify relevant
  articles were developed in an iterative process using the phraseology of the primary question, Boolean operators, and a
  list of synonyms for each term. The search terms will be used to identify relevant articles in CAB Abstracts, Scopus,
  AGRIS, AGRICOLA, Google Scholar, and Google. A test library of 12 articles will ensure that the search captures the
  relevant literature. Searches will be in English but will not be restricted by publication date. The websites of 22
  international organisations with a known interest in gender-related issues will be screened for relevant documents.
  The gender-focussed researchers at large conservation NGOs, the members of the Poverty and Conservation
  Learning Group, and the members of the Gender and Environment Working Group will be invited to submit relevant
  documents. The list of references of included articles will be screened to identify other relevant articles in a â€˜backwards
  snowballingâ€™ approach. The inclusion criteria are that an article refers to women or gender, forests or fisheries, a
  resource management group, a quantitative comparison, and an environmental governance or biodiversity
  conservation outcome in a non-OECD country. A data extraction template with 27 variables will be used to assess
  the included articles. The output will be a narrative report with descriptive statistics and an evidence-gap map.
