How are biodiversity and dispersal
of species affected by the management
of roadsides? A systematic map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are
  similarities between roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures and mown or grazed
  grasslands. In contrast to roadsides, the latter habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century, and
  today only a fraction of their former extent remains. For many species historically associated with these habitats,
  roadsides may therefore function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current
  recommendations for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based on studies of plants
  in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental factors and
  impacts. Moreover, roadsides provide habitats not only for plants but also for many insects, especially if they are sandy
  and exposed to the sun. For these reasons, stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted
  management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity.
  Methods: The proposed systematic map is intended to provide an overview of the available evidence on how bio-
  diversity is affected by various forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the dispersal
  of species along roads or roadsides. Relevant interventions include e.g. mowing, shrub removal, control of invasive/
  nuisance species, sowing or planting, burning, grazing by livestock, scraping and ditching. Non-intervention or alter-
  native forms of roadside management will be used as comparators. Relevant outcomes include measures of species
  or genetic diversity, the abundance of individual species or groups of organisms, species distribution patterns, and
  movement rates of individuals or propagules. Searches will be made for peer-reviewed and grey literature in English
  and several other languages. No geographical restrictions will be applied, and all species and species groups will be
  considered.
