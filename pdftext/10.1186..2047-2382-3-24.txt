  Abstract
  Background: Genetically modified (GM) crops have generated a great deal of controversy. Since commercially
  introduced to farmers in 1996, the global area cultivated with GM crops has increased 94-fold. The rapid adoption
  of GM technology has had substantial socio-economic impacts which a vast amount of technical and non-technical
  literature has addressed in the last two decades. However, contradictory results between individual studies abound.
  Extensive and transparent reviews concerning this contentious and complex issue could help promote evidence-based
  dialogue among the diverse parties involved.
  Methods: This protocol specifies the methodology for identifying, evaluating, and mapping evidence related to the
  main review question: what are the socio-economic impacts of genetically modified crops worldwide? This question
  has been subdivided into the following topics: (a) farm-level impacts; (b) impacts of coexistence regulations; (c) impacts
  along the supply chain; (d) consumer-level impacts; (e) impacts on food security; and (f) environmental economic
  impacts. The search strategy includes the identification of primary studies from general scientific databases; global,
  regional, and national specialist databases; an on-line search engine; institutional websites; journal websites; subject
  experts/researchers; and serendipity. Searches will be conducted in six languages (Chinese, English, French, German,
  Portuguese, and Spanish). Identified studies will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria by a group of multi-language
  reviewers. Finally, pre-defined data from the studies will be extracted, mapped, and presented in a report. Potential
  research gaps will be identified and discussed, and the review process will be documented in an open-access database
  (i.e. CADIMA, http://www.cadima.info/).

    Scopus is a multidisciplinary database, which along with WoS, is considered the most complete and widely used for scientific information identification and
retrieval [52].
(b)
    Google scholar retrieves peer-review and non peer-review publications (grey literature). According to Gehanno et al. [53], one of the advantages of using Google
scholar is that it identifies more types of literature compared to a general scientific database. The results of a study conducted by the same authors suggest that
the current coverage of Google scholar allows retrieving all the high quality studies identified by other general scientific databases such as WoS, and “could be
the first choice for systematic reviews or meta-analysis” [53]. On the negative side, Google scholar is “constantly-changing content, algorithms and database structure”
and Google does not provide details about Google scholar’s database coverage [54]. The results of the searches will be ordered by relevance and the first 1000
documents will be imported to Citavi. The reason for this is that Google scholar limits the retrieval of search results to 1000 documents for any particular search query.

   BASE is one of the largest institutional repository search engines [55], which allows access to 2762 content sources, such as the National Library of Australia,

Table 4 Criteria for classifying included studies
Group                        Characteristics
Farm-level                   The study mainly focuses on the impacts of GM crops at farm-level without considering co-existence issues (see below).
Co-existence                 The study mainly focuses on the impacts of co-existence regulations
Supply chain                 The study mainly focuses on the impacts of GM crops on/ along the supply chain
Consumer level               The study mainly focuses on the impacts of GM crops on consumers.
Environmental economics      The study mainly focuses on the impacts on environmental economics aspects, including economic quantification of:
                             a) agro-biodiversity conservation
                             b) land use changes
                             c) climate change mitigation and production of renewable energy
                             d) others
Food security                The study mainly focuses on the impacts on food security, including:
                             a) physical availability of food
                             b) economic and physical access to food
                             c) food utilization
                             d) stability of the other three dimensions over time
