How susceptible are different lepidopteran/
coleopteran maize pests to Bt-proteins: a systematic
review protocol
Achim Gathmann* and Kai U Priesnitz
  Abstract
  Background: Lepidopteran and coleopteran species are the most important pests in maize. They can be controlled
  using genetically modified crops expressing insecticidal Bt-proteins. The long term success of this technology
  demands a pest resistance management. Important information for a successful management of resistance is the
  baseline susceptibility of the different targeted pests towards the different Bt-proteins. The data on baseline
  susceptibility should enable risk assessors and managers to assess whether a) Bt-maize events represent a high-dose
  to specific target organisms, b) resistance has developed while monitoring the commercial introduction of Bt-maize
  events and c) potential knowledge gaps can be identified.
  Methods: This protocol describes our suggested methods for conducting a systematic review to give an overview
  of the European target pests in maize and their susceptibility to insecticidal Bt-proteins. Both published and
  unpublished data shall be collated. Different sources of information will be searched in order to maximize the
  coverage of the search. All identified publications will be stored in a database. Relevant information for the review
  will be identified in a three step approach based on inclusion criteria. This data set will be an important basis to
  model and assess the potential for evolution of resistance of different crop-Bt-protein-species combinations.
