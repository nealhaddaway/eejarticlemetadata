   Abstract
   Background: Systematic conservation planning is a discipline concerned with the prioritisation of resources for bio-
   diversity conservation and is often used in the design or assessment of terrestrial and marine protected area networks.
   Despite being an evidence-based discipline, to date there has been no comprehensive review of the outcomes of
   systematic conservation plans and assessments of the relative effectiveness of applications in different contexts. To
   address this fundamental gap in knowledge, our primary research question was: what is the extent, distribution and
   robustness of evidence on conservation outcomes of systematic conservation planning around the globe?
   Methods: A systematic mapping exercise was undertaken using standardised search terms across 29 sources, includ-
   ing publication databases, online repositories and a wide range of grey literature sources. The review team screened
   articles recursively, first by title only, then abstract and finally by full-text, using inclusion criteria related to systematic
   conservation plans conducted at sub-global scales and reported on since 1983. We sought studies that reported out-
   comes relating to natural, human, social, financial or institutional outcomes and which employed robust evaluation
   study designs. The following information was extracted from included studies: bibliographic details, background infor-
   mation including location of study and broad objectives of the plan, study design, reported outcomes and context.
   Results: Of the approximately 10,000 unique articles returned through our searches, 1209 were included for full-text
   screening and 43 studies reported outcomes of conservation planning interventions. However, only three studies
   involved the use of evaluation study designs which are suitably rigorous for inclusion, according to best-practice
   guidelines. The three included studies were undertaken in the Gulf of California (Mexico), Réunion Island, and The
   Nature Conservancy’s landholdings across the USA. The studies varied widely in context, purpose and outcomes.
   Study designs were non-experimental or qualitative, and involved use of spatial landholdings over time, stakeholder
   surveys and modelling of alternative planning scenarios.
   Conclusion: Rigorous evaluations of systematic conservation plans are currently not published in academic journals
   or made publicly available elsewhere. Despite frequent claims relating to positive implications and outcomes of these
   planning activities, we show that evaluations are probably rarely conducted. This finding does not imply systematic
   conservation planning is not effective but highlights a significant gap in our understanding of how, when and why
   it may or may not be effective. Our results also corroborate claims that the literature on systematic conservation
   planning is dominated by methodological studies, rather than those that focus on implementation and outcomes,
   and support the case that this is a problematic imbalance in the literature. We emphasise the need for academics
   and practitioners to publish the outcomes of systematic conservation planning exercises and to consider employing

  Fig. 2 A conceptual model for systematic conservation planning (reproduced from the protocol [15]). A range of inputs influence the planning
  process. Outputs and outcomes can arise throughout the planning process but, for simplicity, we have lumped the main stages during the planning
  process. Different types of outputs from the planning process will lead to different types of outcomes. However, given the causal chains are not yet
  well understood, single arrows have been used to indicate the influence of the planning process on the types of potential outputs and outcomes.
  Outputs are the material or legal products of inputs, such as numbers or total k­ m2 of protected areas or numbers of boats available to patrol for
  illegal fishing. Outcomes are the observed or assumed effects of outputs, including reduced threat levels and improved state of biodiversity [58].
  The feedback arrow from outcomes to inputs indicates the adaptive approach used to modify plans subject to observed outcomes
