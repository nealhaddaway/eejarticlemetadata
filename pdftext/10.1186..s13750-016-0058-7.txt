   Abstract
   Background: Global policy initiatives and international conservation organizations have sought to emphasize and
   strengthen the link between the conservation of natural ecosystems and human development. While many indices
   have been developed to measure various social outcomes to conservation interventions, the quantity and strength of
   evidence to support the effects, both positive and negative, of conservation on different dimensions of human well-
   being, remain unclear, dispersed and inconsistent.
   Methods: We searched 11 academic citation databases, two search engines and 30 organisational websites for
   relevant articles using search terms tested with a library of 20 relevant articles. Key informants were contacted with
   requests for articles and possible sources of evidence. Articles were screened for relevance against predefined inclu-
   sion criteria at title, abstract and full text levels according to a published protocol. Included articles were coded using
   a questionnaire. A critical appraisal of eight systematic reviews was conducted to assess the reliability of methods and
   confidence in study findings. A visual matrix of the occurrence and extent of existing evidence was also produced.
   Results: A total of 1043 articles were included in the systematic map database. Included articles measured effects across
   eight nature conservation-related intervention and ten human well-being related outcome categories. Linkages between
   interventions and outcomes with high occurrence of evidence include resource management interventions, such as
   fisheries and forestry, and economic and material outcomes. Over 25 % of included articles examined linkages between
   protected areas and aspects of economic well-being. Fewer than 2 % of articles evaluated human health outcomes.
   Robust study designs were limited with less than 9 % of articles using quantitative approaches to evaluate causal effects of
   interventions. Over 700 articles occurred in forest biomes with less than 50 articles in deserts or mangroves, combined.
   Conclusions: The evidence base is growing on conservation-human well-being linkages, but biases in the extent
   and robustness of articles on key linkages persist. Priorities for systematic review, include linkages between marine
   resource management and economic/material well-being outcomes; and protected areas and governance outcomes.
   Greater and more robust evidence is needed for many established interventions to better understand synergies and
   trade-offs between interventions, in particular those that are emerging or contested.
