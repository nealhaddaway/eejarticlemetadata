  Abstract
  Background: Biodiversity is vital for human well-being, but is threatened by human actions world-wide. In the
  boreal zone, harvesting and management of forests on an industrial scale is the most important factor driving habitat
  change and degradation. Over time different forest management regimes have been implemented but their impact
  on biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales has not been systematically reviewed although non-systematic
  reviews on the topic exist. The aim of this article is to describe a protocol for a systematic review to synthesise and
  compare the impacts of two different forest management systems on biodiversity at different spatial and temporal
  scales. The topic for the systematic review arose from the discussions with the Finnish forestry sector and was further
  defined in a stakeholder workshop. Research questions addressed by the systematic review protocol are: (1) What
  are the stand-level effects of even-aged and uneven-aged forest management on boreal forest biodiversity in Fen-
  noscandia and European Russia? (2) What is the effect of these same forest management systems on biodiversity at
  landscape level?
  Methods: Animal, plant, and fungal diversity is addressed. Bibliographic databases and organizational websites will
  be searched, and internet search engines will be utilized to find relevant literature. The searches will be conducted in
  English, Finnish, Swedish, and Russian. Articles will be screened regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria at title,
  abstract, and full-text stage. The validity of included studies will be evaluated against appraisal criteria and studies
  categorized based on their risk of bias. A narrative synthesis will be conducted to describe the findings. If enough
  quantitative data can be retrieved from the studies, a meta-analysis will be conducted.
  Keywords: Clear-cut, Continuous cover forestry, Landscape, Species diversity, Species richness

Finland 91% of forests are in commercial timber pro-
duction [27] and hence, forest industry has large influ-
ence on forest biodiversity. Specifically, three forestry
companies (Metsä Group, Stora Enso Oyj, and UPM-
Kymmene Oyj), industry representative group Finn-
ish Forest Industries, and the state-owned enterprise
Metsähallitus, which is responsible for the management
of one-third of Finland’s surface area, participated in
the discussions that lead to the broad definition of the
topic. The topic was further defined in a stakeholder
workshop that was held 23 August 2018. Purposive
