  Abstract
  Background: One of the most influential forms of biological invasions is that of invasive ecosystem engineers,
  species that affect other biota via alterations to the abiotic environment. Such species can have wide-reaching
  consequences because they alter ecosystems and essentially “change the rules of existence” for a broad suite of
  resident biota. They thus affect resources or stressors that affect other organisms.The objective of this systematic
  review will be to quantify the positive and negative impacts of invasive ecosystem engineers on ecosystem
  structure and functioning, and to identify factors that cause their effects to vary.
  Methods: We will search a number of online databases to gather empirical evidence from the literature on the
  impacts of invasive ecosystem engineers on: (1) species richness and other univariate and multivariate measures of
  biodiversity; (2) productivity and abundance of algae, and animals; and (3) biogeochemical cycling and other flows
  of energy and materials, including trophic interactions. Data from relevant studies will be extracted and used in a
  random effects meta-analysis in order to estimate the average effect size of invasive ecosystem engineers on each
  response of interest.
