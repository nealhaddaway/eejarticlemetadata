  Abstract
  Background: Forest harvesting is the main driver of habitat degradation and biodiversity loss in forests of the boreal
  zone. To mitigate harmful effects, small-scale habitats with high biodiversity values have been protected within pro-
  duction forests. These include woodland key habitats, and other small-scale habitat patches protected by voluntary
  conservation action. This article describes a protocol for a systematic review to synthesize the value of small habitat
  patches left within production landscapes for biodiversity. The topic for this systematic review arose from a discussion
  with the Finnish forestry sector and was further defined in a stakeholder workshop. Research question: Do small pro-
  tected habitat patches within production forests provide value for biodiversity conservation in boreal forests? Animal,
  plant and fungal diversities are addressed as well as the amount of deadwood within the habitat patches as proxy
  indicators for biodiversity.
  Methods: The literature, both peer-reviewed and grey, will be searched from bibliographical databases, organiza-
  tional websites and internet search engines in English, Finnish, Swedish and Russian. Article screening will be done at
  two stages (title/abstract and full-text). The validity of the studies included will be evaluated against validity criteria
  and studies will be categorized based on their risk of bias. To describe the findings a narrative synthesis will be con-
  ducted. If there is enough quantitative data retrieved from the studies, a meta-analysis will be conducted.
  Keywords: Forest harvesting, Logging, Impact, Woodland key habitats, Voluntary conservation, Species richness,
