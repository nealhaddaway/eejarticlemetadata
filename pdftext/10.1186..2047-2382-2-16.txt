  Abstract
  Background: Eutrophication of aquatic environments is a major environmental problem in large parts of the world.
  In Europe, EU legislation (the Water Framework Directive and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive),
  international conventions (OSPAR, HELCOM) and national environmental objectives emphasize the need to reduce
  the input of plant nutrients to freshwater and marine environments. A widely used method to achieve this is to let
  water pass through a constructed or restored wetland (CW). However, the large variation in measured nutrient
  removal rates in such wetlands calls for a systematic review. The objective of this review is to quantify nitrogen and
  phosphorus removal rates in constructed or restored wetlands and relate them to wetland characteristics, loading
  characteristics, and climate factors. Wetlands are created to treat water from a number of different sources. Sources
  that will be considered in this review include agricultural runoff and urban storm water run-off, as well as
  aquaculture wastewater and outlets from domestic wastewater treatment plants, with particular attention to the
  situation in Sweden. Although the performance of wetlands in temperate and boreal regions is most relevant to
  the Swedish stakeholders a wider range of climatic conditions will be considered in order to make a thorough
  evaluation of climatic factors.
  Methods: Searches for primary studies will be performed in electronic databases as well as on the internet. One
  author will perform the screening of all retrieved articles at the title and abstract level. To check that the screening
  is consistent and complies with the agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria, subsets of 100 articles will be screened by
  the other authors. When screening at full-text level the articles will be evenly distributed among the authors. Kappa
  tests will be used to evaluate screening consistency. Data synthesis will be based on meta-regression. The nutrient
  removal rates will be taken as response variables and the effect modifiers will be used as explanatory variables.
  More specifically, the meta-regression will be performed using generalized additive models that can handle
  nonlinear relationships and major interaction effects. Furthermore, subgroup analyses will be undertaken to
  elucidate statistical relationships that are specific to particular types of wetlands.
