   Abstract
   Background: Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For fish that require substrate for spawn-
   ing, lack of appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will
   lead to population collapse. To ensure management resources are being allocated wisely and conservation targets are
   being achieved, there is an increased need to consider the effectiveness of techniques to enhance or create habitat
   that has been lost. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of techniques currently used
   to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate-spawning (including vegetation-spawning) fish in temperate
   regions, and to investigate the factors that influence the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement.
   Methods: Searches for primary research studies on the effect of spawning habitat creation or enhancement for
   substrate-spawning fish were conducted in bibliographic databases, on websites and an online search engine,
   through evidence call-outs, social media, and Advisory Team contacts, and in the bibliographies of relevant reviews.
   All articles were screened at two stages (title and abstract, and full-text), with consistency checks being performed at
   each stage. Relevant articles were critically appraised and meta-data and quantitative data were extracted into a data-
   base. All included studies were described narratively and studies that met the criteria for meta-analysis were analyzed
   quantitatively.
   Review findings: A total of 75 studies from 64 articles were included in this systematic review and underwent data
   extraction and critical appraisal. The majority of these studies were from North America (78.1%) and a large percent-
   age (63.7%) targeted salmonids. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 22 studies with 53 data sets. Avail-
   able evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., gravel, cobble) was effective in increasing
   the abundance of substrate-spawning fish compared to controls, with a taxonomic bias towards salmonids (5/6
   data sets). The addition of plant material (e.g., large woody debris) with or without physical alterations to the water-
   body (e.g., excavation) was also effective in increasing substrate-spawning fish abundance on average compared to
   controls. Egg life stages (i.e., nests, redds, zygotes or developing embryos) were associated with larger increases in
   abundance with habitat creation or enhancement than age-0 life stages (i.e., alevin, fry, young-of-the-year). We found

  no detectable effect of ecosystem type (lotic vs. lentic waterbodies) or time since habitat creation or enhancement on
  intervention effectiveness for fish abundance.
  Conclusions: The synthesis of available evidence suggests that the addition or alteration of rock material (e.g., addi-
  tion of gravel, substrate washing) was an effective means of enhancing spawning habitat, but results may only be
  applicable for salmonids. Furthermore, the synthesis suggests that on average, the addition of plant material with or
  without waterbody modifications was also effective at increasing fish abundance. Overall, we were limited in our abil-
  ity to address many of the questions that stakeholders have regarding the circumstances under which spawning habi-
  tat creation or enhancement is effective for substrate-spawning fish. Before we can provide recommendations with a
  higher level of certainty, we need to improve research and reporting, and expand research focus to include a broader
  range of species and intervention types. We provide several recommendations aimed at researchers and practitioners
  to improve the quality of evidence being generated.
