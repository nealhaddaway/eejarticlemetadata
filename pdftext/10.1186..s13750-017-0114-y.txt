  Abstract
  Background: There is a concern that continued emissions of man-made per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)
  may cause environmental and human health effects. Now widespread in human populations and in the environment,
  several PFASs are also present in remote regions of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of PFASs are
  not well understood. Phasing out the manufacture of some types of PFASs started in 2000 and further regulatory and
  voluntary actions have followed. The objective of this review is to understand the effects of these actions on global
  scale PFAS concentrations.
  Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations were
  performed in bibliographic databases, on the internet, through stakeholder contacts and in review bibliographies. No
  time, document type, language or geographical constraints were applied in the searches. Relevant subjects included
  human and environmental samples. Two authors screened all retrieved articles. Dual screening of 10% of the articles
  was performed at title/abstract and full-text levels by all authors. Kappa tests were used to test consistency. Relevant
  articles were critically appraised by four reviewers, with double checking of 20% of the articles by a second reviewer.
  Meta-analysis of included temporal trends was considered but judged to not be appropriate. The trends were there-
  fore discussed in a narrative synthesis.
  Results: Available evidence suggests that human concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluoro-
  decane sulfonate (PFDS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) generally are declining, while previously increasing
  concentrations of perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) have begun to level off. Rapid declines for PFOS-precursors
  (e.g. perfluorooctane sulfonamide, FOSA) have also been consistently observed in human studies. In contrast, limited
  data indicate that human concentrations of PFOS and PFOA are increasing in China where the production of these
  substances has increased. Human concentrations of longer-chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) with 9–14
  carbon atoms are generally increasing or show insignificant trends with too low power to detect a trend. For abiotic
  and biological environmental samples there are no clear patterns of declining trends. Most substances show mixed
  results, and a majority of the trends are insignificant with low power to detect a trend.

   Conclusions: For electrochemically derived PFASs, including PFOS and PFOA, most human studies in North America
   and Europe show consistent statistically significant declines. This contrasts with findings in wildlife and in abiotic
   environmental samples, suggesting that declining PFOS, PFOS-precursor and PFOA concentrations in humans likely
   resulted from removal of certain PFASs from commercial products including paper and board used in food packaging.
   Increasing concentrations of long-chain PFCAs in most matrices, and in most regions, is likely due to increased use of
   alternative PFASs. Continued temporal trend monitoring in the environment with well-designed studies with high sta-
   tistical power are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of past and continuing regulatory mitigation measures. For
   humans, more temporal trend studies are needed in regions where manufacturing is most intense, as the one human
   study available in China is much different than in North America or Europe.

The same figure also shows the number of datasets that
were re-analysed in this review and the number of time
trends that originally were reported by the authors of the
reviewed articles, respectively. The most frequently ana-
lyzed substance is PFOS, followed by PFOA.
   Most of the studies were conducted in North Amer-
ica and Europe followed by the Arctic. A small number
of additional studies have been conducted in East Asia.
From the southern hemisphere only one study, inves-
tigating PFASs in human blood serum in an Australian
population, was included [138]. Figure 3 shows the distri-
bution between geographical areas.
   The total number of time trend datasets on human
samples was 84, and for the vast majority of these the
studied matrix was blood plasma or serum. Plasma and
serum are considered equivalent matrices for monitor-
ing time trends of PFASs. Two other datasets were con-
centrations in whole blood and in two other datasets the
matrix was milk from lactating women (Fig. 4).
   Nine datasets involved food samples, and 31 datasets
were found for abiotic environmental samples including
air, snow/ice, water, and sediment. Man-made matri-
