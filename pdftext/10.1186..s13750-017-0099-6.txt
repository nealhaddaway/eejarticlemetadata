   Abstract
   Background: This paper provides guidance about how to plan, prepare, conduct, report, amend or update a system-
   atic search. It aims to contribute to a new version of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) Guidelines for
   Systematic Reviews in Environmental Management, and the methods we describe are likely to be broadly applicable
   across a wider range of topics. In evidence synthesis, searches are expected to be repeatable, fit for purpose, with
   minimum biases, and to collate a maximum number of relevant articles. Failing to include relevant information in an
   evidence synthesis may lead to inaccurate or skewed conclusions and/or changes in conclusions as soon as the omit-
   ted information is added.
   Method: The paper takes into account similar documents produced by the Cochrane Collaboration and the Camp-
   bell Collaboration, including necessary adjustments for environmental policy and management, and the current ver-
   sion of the CEE Guidelines (version 4.2, 2013). Where possible this guidance is based on evidence from research, and
   in its absence on expert opinion and experience.
   Results: Here we aim to provide guidance on the optimal search structure as the basis on which any evidence syn-
   thesis should be built.
   Conclusion: It is aimed at all those who intend to conduct systematic evidence synthesis, including reviews and
