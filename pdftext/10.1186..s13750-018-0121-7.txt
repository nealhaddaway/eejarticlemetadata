  Abstract
  Reliable synthesis of the various rapidly expanding bodies of evidence is vital for the process of evidence-informed
  decision-making in environmental policy, practice and research. With the rise of evidence-base medicine and increas-
  ing numbers of published systematic reviews, criteria for assessing the quality of reporting have been developed.
  First QUOROM (Lancet 354:1896–1900, 1999) and then PRISMA (Ann Intern Med 151:264, 2009) were developed as
  reporting guidelines and standards to ensure medical meta-analyses and systematic reviews are reported to a high
  level of detail. PRISMA is now widely used by a range of journals as a pre-submission checklist. However, due to its
  development for systematic reviews in healthcare, PRISMA has limited applicability for reviews in conservation and
  environmental management. We highlight 12 key problems with the application of PRISMA to this field, including
  an overemphasis on meta-analysis and no consideration for other synthesis methods. We introduce ROSES (RepOrt-
  ing standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses), a pro forma and flow diagram designed specifically for systematic
  reviews and systematic maps in the field of conservation and environmental management. We describe how ROSES
  solves the problems with PRISMA. We outline the key benefits of our approach to designing ROSES, in particular the
  level of detail and inclusion of rich guidance statements. We also introduce the extraction of meta-data that describe
  key aspects of the conduct of the review. Collated together, this summary record can help to facilitate rapid review
  and appraisal of the conduct of a systematic review or map, potentially speeding up the peer-review process. We pre-
  sent the results of initial road testing of ROSES with systematic review experts, and propose a plan for future develop-
  ment of ROSES.

Table 1 Key problems relating to the application of PRISMA [24] to evidence synthesis in conservation and environmen‑
tal management
Problem 1:   Does not strictly require a protocol, refers to registration (e.g. PRISMA [24] checklist #5 “Indicate if a review protocol exists, if and where it
               can be accessed (e.g., Web address), and, if available, provide registration information including registration number”)
Problem 2:   Vagueness hides necessary level of transparency to allow repeatability (e.g. no requirements to provide details of which databases are
               accessed via Web of Knowledge or Proquest, PRISMA [24] checklist #7)
Problem 3:   Suggested requirements for review conduct are minimal, affecting overall comprehensiveness of the review (e.g. repeatable reporting of
               search in “at least one database” required only, PRISMA [24] checklist #8)
Problem 4:   Heavy emphasis on meta-analysis (excludes narrative, qualitative and mixed synthesis methods): e.g. PRISMA [24] checklist #13 ‘Summary
               measures’: “State the principal summary measures (e.g., risk ratio, difference in means)”, PRISMA [24] checklist #14 ‘Synthesis of results’:
               “Describe the methods of handling data and combining results of studies, if done, including measures of consistency (e.g., I­2) for each
               meta-analysis”, PRISMA [24] checklist #21 ‘Synthesis of results’: “Present results of each meta-analysis done, including confidence inter-
               vals and measures of consistency”
Problem 5:   Lost nuance of necessary methodological steps: e.g. lack of consistency and comprehensiveness checking, no requirement to avoid bias
               caused by reviewing and appraising one’s own research
Problem 6:   Focuses on risk of bias rather than limitations to validity: ignores external validity and limitations that do not affect bias (e.g. PRISMA [24]
               checklist #15 and #22)
Problem 7:   Focuses on medicine and health topics (e.g. PRISMA [24] checklist #9 ‘Results of individual studies’: “For all outcomes considered (benefits
               or harms), present, for each study: (a) simple summary data for each intervention group (b) effect estimates and confidence intervals,
               ideally with a forest plot”)
Problem 8:   Non-matching terminology: e.g. separating ‘screening’ from ‘eligibility’ (see PRISMA [24] flow-diagram)
Problem 9:   Inappropriate use of the term ‘qualitative synthesis’ meaning ‘narrative synthesis’ (see PRISMA Statement [24])
Problem 10:  PRISMA checklist misses vital information from the PRISMA [24] flow-diagram: e.g. exclusions during critical appraisal
Problem 11:  Often misused as methodological rather than reporting guidance [34]
Problem 12:  PRISMA checklist is only useful for authors and editors during submission: no further information provided within the process of comple-

Table 2 Key differences between ROSES and PRISMA in relation to the problems identified with PRISMA (see Table 1)
Difference 1:   Tailored to environmental systematic reviews AND systematic maps (solution to Problem 1, 6, 7, 8)
Difference 2:   Higher standards of reporting (more details requested) in checklist, summary and flow diagram (solution to Problems 2, 5 and 10)
Difference 3:   Higher standards of conduct and clearer when standards not fully met (solution to Problem 3)
Difference 4:   Reduces emphasis on quantitative synthesis (e.g. meta-analysis etc.) that is only reliable when used for appropriate data in a sensible
                  way (solution to Problem 4)
Difference 5:   Accommodate other types of synthesis (narrative and qualitative synthesis) (solution to Problem 4 and 9)
Difference 6:   Consistent and appropriate terminology (e.g. confusion of ‘qualitative synthesis’ and ‘narrative synthesis’ in PRISMA flow chart) (solution
                  to Problem 8 and 9)
Difference 7:   Corrects problems with PRISMA focusing on bias rather than internal and external validity) (solution to Problem 6)
