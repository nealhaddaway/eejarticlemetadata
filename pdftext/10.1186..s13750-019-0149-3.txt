What is the effectiveness of using
conspecific or heterospecific acoustic playbacks
for the attraction of animals for wildlife
management? A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Many animals are attracted to the sounds of their conspecifics and some are attracted to the sounds
  of other species. Therefore, wildlife managers have begun to capitalize on this attraction to lure animals to specific
  places by broadcasting vocalizations—a method referred to as acoustic playback. Playbacks have been conducted
  to attract animals for capture, encourage birds to use specific nest boxes, attract animals to safe locations where they
  can breed, or to lure animals to habitats away from human disturbances. However, there has been no evaluation of
  the general effectiveness of this intervention on the attraction of animals for wildlife management. We describe a
  protocol to systematically review the literature of the effectiveness of using playbacks so that conservation practition-
  ers can make informed wildlife management decisions.
  Methods: The review will examine primary field studies that use acoustic playbacks to attract animals for wildlife
  management. Playbacks could be of conspecifics, heterospecifics, or both. We will search various bibliographic
  databases, online search engines, and specialist websites for relevant studies. We will screen studies first on title and
  abstract, then on full text. We will only include studies that measure quantitative results. Relevant outcomes will
  include the attraction of animals to playbacks and encompass various management goals: to capture the animal, to
  persuade the animal to use a new breeding location, and/or to persuade the animal to settle in a location during the
  study duration. Studies must be based on comparison between conditions before and after intervention, on compari-
  son between treatment and control plots, or both. Inter-reviewer consistency in article inclusion will be performed
  with 10% of the titles and abstracts and 10% of the full texts. We will critically appraise the literature based on study
  type and design, sample sizes, study duration, and other aspects of methodology. We will extract data and meta-
  data including various potential effect modifiers (e.g., taxon). Finally, we will evaluate the effectiveness of playbacks
  through a narrative synthesis of the evidence, and quantitative synthesis (i.e., meta-analysis) if sufficient data (more
  than two studies) of similar outcomes are found.
