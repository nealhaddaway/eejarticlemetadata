  Abstract
  Background: The loss of carbon (C) from agricultural soils has been, in part, attributed to tillage, a common prac‑
  tice providing a number of benefits to farmers. The promotion of less intensive tillage practices and no tillage (NT)
  (the absence of mechanical soil disturbance) aims to mitigate negative impacts on soil quality and to preserve soil
  organic carbon (SOC). Several reviews and meta-analyses have shown both beneficial and null effects on SOC due to
  no tillage relative to conventional tillage, hence there is a need for a comprehensive systematic review to answer the
  question: what is the impact of reduced tillage intensity on SOC?
  Methods: We systematically reviewed relevant research in boreo-temperate regions using, as a basis, evidence iden‑
  tified within a recently completed systematic map on the impacts of farming on SOC. We performed an update of the
  original searches to include studies published since the map search. We screened all evidence for relevance according
  to predetermined inclusion criteria. Studies were appraised and subject to data extraction. Meta-analyses were per‑
  formed to investigate the impact of reducing tillage [from high (HT) to intermediate intensity (IT), HT to NT, and from
  IT to NT] for SOC concentration and SOC stock in the upper soil and at lower depths.
  Results: A total of 351 studies were included in the systematic review: 18% from an update of research published
  in the 2 years since the systematic map. SOC concentration was significantly higher in NT relative to both IT [1.18 g/
  kg ± 0.34 (SE)] and HT [2.09 g/kg ± 0.34 (SE)] in the upper soil layer (0–15 cm). IT was also found to be significant
  higher [1.30 g/kg ± 0.22 (SE)] in SOC concentration than HT for the upper soil layer (0–15 cm). At lower depths, only IT
  SOC compared with HT at 15–30 cm showed a significant difference; being 0.89 g/kg [± 0.20 (SE)] lower in intermedi‑
  ate intensity tillage. For stock data NT had significantly higher SOC stocks down to 30 cm than either HT [4.61 Mg/
  ha ± 1.95 (SE)] or IT [3.85 Mg/ha ± 1.64 (SE)]. No other comparisons were significant.
  Conclusions: The transition of tilled croplands to NT and conservation tillage has been credited with substantial
  potential to mitigate climate change via C storage. Based on our results, C stock increase under NT compared to HT
  was in the upper soil (0–30 cm) around 4.6 Mg/ha (0.78–8.43 Mg/ha, 95% CI) over ≥ 10 years, while no effect was
  detected in the full soil profile. The results support those from several previous studies and reviews that NT and IT
  increase SOC in the topsoil. Higher SOC stocks or concentrations in the upper soil not only promote a more produc‑
  tive soil with higher biological activity but also provide resilience to extreme weather conditions. The effect of tillage
  practices on total SOC stocks will be further evaluated in a forthcoming project accounting for soil bulk densities and
  crop yields. Our findings can hopefully be used to guide policies for sustainable management of agricultural soils.

Tillage category               Description
No tillage                     No tillage activities undertaken. Also described as direct drill. Some machine activity is present where crops are planted
                                 or seeds broadcast, or where fertilisers and pesticides are applied. Light scarification of the soil surface may also occur
Intermediate                   Soil is disturbed to a maximum depth not exceeding 40 cm and using only non-inversion tillage machinery; i.e. the soil
  intensity tillage              profile is not inverted by means of turning apparatus such as a mouldboard. Examples include; chisel plough, disking,
                                 heavy duty cultivator, rotavator, rotary harrow, grubber, and field cultivator
High intensity tillage         Full inversion tillage occurs where the soil profile is inverted by means of turning apparatus such as a mouldboard. Non-

for these subgroup analyses were produced using coef-
