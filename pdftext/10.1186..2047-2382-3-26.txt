What are the local impacts of energy systems on
marine ecosystem services: a systematic map
protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) and its impact on the climate has
  resulted in many international governments committing to reduce their GHG emissions. The UK, for example, has
  committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Suggested ways of reaching such a target are to
  increase dependency on offshore wind, offshore gas and nuclear. It is not clear, however, how the construction,
  operation and decommissioning of these energy systems will impact marine ecosystem services, i.e. the services
  obtained by people from the natural environment such as food provisioning, climate regulation and cultural inspiration.
  Research on ecosystem service impacts associated with offshore energy technologies is still in its infancy. The objective
  of this review is to bolster the evidence base by firstly, recording and describing the impacts of energy technologies at
  the marine ecosystems and human level in a consistent and transparent way; secondly, to translate these ecosystem and
  human impacts into ecosystem service impacts by using a framework to ensure consistency and comparability. The
  output of this process will be an objective synthesis of ecosystem service impacts comprehensive enough to cover
  different types of energy under the same analysis and to assist in informing how the provision of ecosystem services will
  change under different energy provisioning scenarios.
  Methods: Relevant studies will be sourced using publication databases and selected using a set of selection criteria
  including the identification of: (i) relevant subject populations such as marine and coastal species, marine habitat types
  and the general public; (ii) relevant exposure types including offshore wind farms, offshore oil and gas platforms and
  offshore structures connected with nuclear; (iii) relevant outcomes including changes in species structure and diversity;
  changes in benthic, demersal and pelagic habitats; and changes in cultural services. The impacts will be synthesised and
  described using a systematic map. To translate these findings into ecosystem service impacts, the Common International
  Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) frameworks are used and a
  detailed description of the steps taken provided to ensure transparency and replicability.
  Keywords: Energy systems, Ecosystem impacts, Ecosystem service impacts, Biodiversity, Habitats, Ecosystem functions,
