  Abstract
  Background: Biological invasions are among the most severe threats to marine biodiversity. The impacts of
  introduced seaweeds on native macroalgal assemblages have been thoroughly reviewed. In contrast, no attempt
  has been made to synthesize the available information on the effects of exotic seaweeds on other trophic levels. In
  addition, it has not been clarified whether the effects of introduced seaweeds on native assemblages vary
  according to background physical and biological conditions.
  Methods: This protocol provides details of our proposed method to carry out a systematic review aiming to
  identify and synthesize existing knowledge to answer the following primary questions: a) how does the impact of
  the presence of exotic seaweeds on native primary consumers (across trophic levels) compare in magnitude and
  extent to that observed on native primary producers (same trophic level)?; b) does the intensity of the effects of the
  presence of exotic seaweeds on native benthic ecosystems vary along a gradient of human disturbance (i.e. from
  urban/industrial areas to extra-urban areas to pristine areas)?
