Use of literature mining for early
identification of emerging contaminants
in freshwater resources

  Abstract
  Chemical and microbial contaminants in the aquatic environment pose a potential threat to humans and to ecosys-
  tems. Humans may be exposed to contaminants in water resources when used for drinking water production, agricul-
  ture, aquaculture or recreation. Climatological, social and demographic changes, as well as the increasing sensitivity
  of analytical techniques, may result in the augmented detection of contaminants. Recent research has shown that it
  takes about 15 years from the time of the first scientific study mentioning the presence of a contaminant in the envi-
  ronment for the issue to peak in scientific attention and regulatory action. One possible factor influencing this lengthy
  period is that the first article becomes lost in the vast number of publications. In this study, we therefore developed a
  methodology using literature mining to identify the first scientific study which reports the presence of a contaminant
  in the aquatic environment. The developed semi-automated methodology enables health and environment agen-
  cies to inform policy makers about contaminants in the aquatic environment that could be significant for public and
  environmental health in national, international and river basin settings. The methodology thereby assists the proactive
  governance of emerging contaminants in the aquatic environment. This was illustrated by a retrospective analysis of
  the period of emergence in the Netherlands of: (1) perfluorooctanoic acid in surface water, and (2) biological indus-
  trial wastewater treatment systems as potential infection sources for Legionnaires´ disease.
