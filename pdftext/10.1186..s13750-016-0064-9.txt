effectiveness of on‑farm conservation land
management strategies for preserving
ecosystem services in developing countries? A
systematic map

   Abstract
   Background: An extensive body of evidence in the field of agro-ecology claims to show the positive effects that
   maintenance of ecosystem services can have on meeting future food demand by making farms more sustainable,
   productive and resilient, which then contributes to improved nutrition and livelihoods of farmers. However, inconsist-
   ent effects have commonly been reported, while empirical evidence to support assumed improvements is largely
   lacking. Overall, a coherent synthesis and review of the evidence of these claims is largely absent from the literature.
   Methods: Systematic searches of peer-reviewed research were conducted in bibliographic databases of Web of
   Science, SCOPUS, AGRICOLA, AGRIS databases and CAB abstracts, and grey literature from Google Scholar, and 32
   subject-specific websites. Searches identified 21,147 articles. After screening, 746 studies were included in the final
   map.
   Results: Of the 19 conservation land management practices considered, soil fertilisation (24 %), tillage (23 %), agro-
   forestry (9 %), and water conservation (7 %) were most commonly studied. Ecosystem services most commonly stud-
   ied were supporting (55 %) and regulating (33 %), particularly carbon sequestration/storage, nutrient cycling and soil/
   water regulation/supply. Key data gaps identified included the absence of long-term records (with datasets spanning
   >20 years), studies located in North and Central Africa, research that focuses on smallholder landscapes, and studies
   that span different scales (regional and landscape levels).
   Conclusions: The study employs systematic mapping combined with an online interactive platform that geographi-
   cally maps results, which allows users to interrogate different aspects of the evidence through a defined database
   field structure. While studies are not directly comparable, the database of 746 studies brings together a previously
   fragmented and multidisciplinary literature base, and collectively provides evidence concerning a wide range of con-
   servation land management practices impacting key ecosystem services. The systematic map is easily updatable, and
   may be extended for additional coding, analysed to assess the quality of studies, or used to inform future systematic
   reviews.

   Fig. 13 Water regulation indicators. Eight-five indicators were used to in studies measuring water regulation. Most common indicators included
   yield, water holding capacity/soil moisture retention, potassium, pH, particle size, water use efficiency, runoff, water infiltration rate, temperature,
   income and carbon dioxide. Perception of water quality was measured in six studies. Electric conductivity (liquids), cation exchange capability,
   dissolved organic carbon, and turbidity/water stable aggregates were measured in four studies. Metrics of evapotranspiration, groundwater depth,
   and erosion control were measured in three studies, and surface flow and base saturation in two studies

   Fig. 14 Cultural service indicators. Forty-three indicators were used in studies measuring cultural services. Social indicators (e.g. spiritual and sym-
   bolic value) were the best represented cultural service (n = 10 articles), followed by educational (n = 8), aesthetic/bequest (n = 8) [67], recreational
   (n = 6), and tourism/ornamental value (n = 5). Methods applied included: a preference-based analysis procedure [67]; ethnography [64]; transect
   walks; semi-structured interviews [68]; stakeholder workshops [67]; focus groups; and life-history interviews [69]. In particular, religious value was
   commonly inferred by identifying sacred sites, locations where ritual practice was carried out, and the number of ritual artefacts used for festivals
   and weddings [67]. Other studies used the proxy of farmers’ donations of cereal grains to religious institutions [67]
