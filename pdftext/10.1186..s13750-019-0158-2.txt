   Abstract
   Background: Captive breeding programs are one of the many tools used by conservation practitioners as a means
   of conserving, supporting, and supplementing populations of imperilled species. Captive breeding programs exist
   around the globe for freshwater mussels and fishes, but the availability of evidence exploring the effectiveness of
   these programs has not yet been explored using systematic map criteria. This systematic map aims to identify, collate
   and describe the evidence that exists on the effectiveness of captive breeding programs, for the purpose of achieving
   conservation targets for imperilled freshwater fishes and mussels in the wild. The outputs of this systematic map will
   help to inform conservation managers and policy makers who are responsible for protecting imperilled freshwater
   species by identifying existing information and highlighting key information gaps for captive breeding programs
   operating in temperate regions.
   Methods: This systematic map will search for, compile, and map existing literature on the effectiveness of captive
   breeding programs for the conservation of imperilled freshwater fishes and mussels. The systematic map will search
   using five bibliographic databases, two public search engines, and 19 specialist websites and will include both
   primary and grey literature. All studies that discuss details related to captive breeding programs for the conservation
   of imperilled freshwater fishes and/or mussels in temperate regions will be included in the map. The systematic map
   will produce a narrative report describing the evidence, including knowledge gaps evidence clusters, and a MS-Excel
   searchable database of articles and extracted metadata.
