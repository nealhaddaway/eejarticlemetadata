The effectiveness of integrated farm management,
organic farming and agri-environment schemes
for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe -
A systematic map
Nicola P Randall* and Katy L James
  Abstract
  Background: Agriculture is the dominant land use throughout much of Europe. Changes to farming practices have
  led to concerns about negative impacts on biodiversity, and current agricultural policy has an emphasis towards
  conservation. The objective of this study was to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research
  pertaining to the effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes as
  interventions for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe.
  Systematic mapping methodology was adapted from social sciences, and used to create a searchable database of
  relevant research.
  Methods: Searches were made of 10 electronic databases containing peer reviewed journals, PhD theses,
  conference proceedings and organisational reports. Web searches for relevant research were also made. The title
  and abstracts of results were examined for relevance. Studies were included when published in English, when an
  intervention was applied to increase biodiversity or species diversity on farmland, and where there was a measured
  effect on study organism(s). Correlative and manipulative studies from temperate Europe were included. The
  research was incorporated into a searchable database (systematic map) and key wording used to describe,
  categorise and code studies.
  Results: The searches identified 83,590 records. Following removal of duplicates and the application of inclusion
  criteria, 743 references were coded for the final systematic map database. Most of the studies reported were from
  Western Europe, particularly from the UK. Invertebrates were the most commonly studied organism followed by
  plants and birds, and field margins were the most commonly studied biotope.
  Conclusions: The systematic map describes the scope of research on the topic. It can be used to inform future
  primary research, or research synthesis and evaluation methods such as systematic review. Areas for which there
  appear to be evidence gaps, and so may have potential for further primary research, are highlighted. They include
  the effectiveness of agri-environment options under different farming systems and in providing for amphibians and
  reptiles. Implications for the development of future systematic maps are discussed, including the question of how
  to incorporate study quality appraisal. The development of a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence systematic
  mapping methods group will address some of these issues.
