  Abstract
  Background: Loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) from agricultural land is identified as one of the major threats to
  soils, as it influences both fertility and the production of ecosystem services from agriculture. Losses of SOC across
  regions are often determined by monitoring in different land use systems. Results from agricultural field experiments
  can reveal increasing SOC stocks after implementation of specific management practices compared to a control,
  though in time series experiments the relative rate of change is often negative and implying an overall loss. Long-
  term agricultural field experiments are indispensable for quantifying absolute changes in SOC stocks under different
  management regimes. Since SOC responses are seldom linear over time, time series data from these experiments are
  particularly valuable.
  Methods: This systematic review is based on studies reporting time series data collated in a recently completed sys‑
  tematic map on the topic restricted to the warm temperate climate zone and the snow climate zone. These 53 studies
  were identified and selected systematically according to CEE guidelines. An update of the original search for studies
  will be repeated using Web of Science and Google Scholar to include newly published academic and grey literature
  in the time since the original search was performed in September 2013. Studies will be subject to critical appraisal of
  the internal and external validity, followed by full data extraction (meta-data describing study settings and quantita‑
  tive study results). Where possible, studies will be included in a quantitative synthesis using time series meta-analytical
  approaches. The implications of the meta-analytical findings will be discussed in terms of policy, practice and research
  along with a discussion of the nature of the evidence base.

globally. This subject is particularly relevant in Europe,
because of the recent EU decision [10] to introduce man-
datory accounting of cropland and grazing land manage-
ment for EU Member States. Furthermore, the FAO has
expressed its interest in SOC preservation by hosting the
global soil partnership and the intergovernmental techni-
cal panel on soils, with the aims of contributing to envi-
ronmental wellbeing in the following ways: by preventing
soil erosion and degradation; by reducing greenhouse gas
emissions; by promoting SOC sequestration; by promot-
ing sustainable use of agricultural inputs for soil health
and ecosystems management [11].
