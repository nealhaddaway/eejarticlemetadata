Evidence for the effects
of neonicotinoids used in arable crop
production on non‑target organisms
and concentrations of residues in relevant
matrices: a systematic map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) have been routinely used in arable crop protection since their devel-
  opment in the early 1990s. These insecticides have been subject to the same registration procedures as other groups
  of pesticides, thus meet the same environmental hazard standards as all crop protection products. However, during
  the last 10 years the debate regarding their possible detrimental impact on non-target organisms, particularly pollina-
  tors, has become increasingly contentious and widely debated. Against this background, legislators and politicians in
  some countries, have been faced with a need to make decisions on the future registration of some or all of this class
  of insecticides, based on published evidence that in some areas is incomplete or limited in extent. This has created
  much concern in agricultural communities that consider that the withdrawal of these insecticides is likely to have
  significant negative economic, socio-economic and environmental consequences.
  Methods: The proposed systematic map aims to address the following primary question: What is the available
  evidence for the effects of neonicotinoids used in arable crop production on non-target organisms and concentra-
  tions of residues in relevant matrices? The primary question will be divided into two sub-questions to gather research
  literature for (1) the effect of NNIs on non-target organisms (2) the occurrence of concentrations of NNIs in matrices
  of relevance to non-target organisms (i.e. exposure routes). The systematic map will focus on NNIs used in arable crop
  production: imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, thiacloprid and dinotefuran. Separate inclusion
  criteria have been developed for each sub-question. Traditional academic and grey literature will be searched for in
  English language and a searchable databases containing extracted meta-data from relevant included studies will be
  developed.
