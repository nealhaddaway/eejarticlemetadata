How effective are slurry storage, cover or catch
crops, woodland creation, controlled trafficking or
break-up of compacted layers, and buffer strips
as on-farm mitigation measures for delivering an
improved water environment?
Nicola P Randall*, Louise M Donnison and Paul J Lewis
  Abstract
  Background: Agriculture has intensified over the last 50 years resulting in increased usage of fertilizers and
  agrochemicals, changes in cropping practices, land drainage and increased stocking rates. In Europe, this has
  resulted in declines in the quality of soils and waters due to increased run off and water pollution. Fifty percent of
  nitrates in European rivers are derived from agricultural sources in the UK this value is as high as 70%, where
  agriculture also contributes to approximately 28% of phosphates and 76% of sediments recorded in rivers.
  Catchments dominated by agricultural land use have increased levels of pesticides and bacterial pathogens.
  European member states have a policy commitment to tackle water pollution through the Water Framework
  Directive. An analysis of the effectiveness of water pollution mitigation measures should enable decision makers
  and delivery agencies to better facilitate catchment planning.
  The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of slurry storage, cover/catch crops, woodland
  creation, controlled trafficking/break-up of compacted layers and buffer strips, as on farm mitigation measures, for
  delivering an improved water environment.
  Methods: The systematic review will consist of a searchable systematic map database for all the named
  interventions. Where possible, quantitative analysis will be used to assess the effectiveness of interventions.
  Electronic databases, the internet, and organisational websites will be searched, and stakeholders will be contacted
  for studies that investigate the impact of the on-farm mitigation measures on water quality. All studies found will
  be assessed for suitability for inclusion in the next stage. Inclusion criteria will be based on subject, intervention,
  comparator and outcome. The details of included studies will be incorporated into the systematic map database,
  and studies scored for effectiveness of intervention and study design. Where there is suitable data available,
  meta-analysis will be carried out to test the effectiveness of individual mitigation measures. A report will summarise
  the evidence, highlight any gaps in the available research, and provide recommendations for future research.
