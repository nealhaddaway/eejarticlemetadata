What are the non-food impacts of GM crop
cultivation on farmers’ health?

  Abstract
  Background: With a steady increase in the area cultivated with genetically modified (GM) crops, the impacts of GM
  crop cultivation are coming under closer scrutiny around the world. The impacts on humans usually refer to
  possible risks to health occurring as a result of the GM food consumption. Other concerns, such as the claims of
  human health benefits arising from the cultivation of GM crops via reduced use of pesticides could be considered,
  if at all, under economic impacts of the technology. Similarly, other human health impacts could occur as a result
  of a modification of the amount of pesticides residues found in underground water, which could be considered
  under environmental impacts.
  Yet many GM crops are not consumed on-farm, either because they require processing before becoming edible
  (such as soya bean, cottonseed and oilseed) or because the entire harvest is sold to maximise profits. It would be
  certainly difficult to demonstrate the importance of GM foods health effects versus the non-food health effects of
  GM crop cultivation on farmers. However, the non-food health effects, although apparently receiving less attention,
  deserve a closer look because of their potential economic and environmental links.
  Methods/design: The primary research question is: What are the non-food impacts of GM crop cultivation on
  farmers’ health? To address specifically the main research question, the analysis focuses on two related secondary
  questions: 1) Does the cultivation of GM crops result in a lower number of pesticide-related poisonings? and 2)
  Does the cultivation of GM crops allow for higher financial resources to be used by farmers to improve their and
  their family’s health status? Further, the review will also evaluate the extent to which information relevant to the
  two secondary questions is freely-available. The abstracts of non-free articles, alongside their bibliographic details,
  will be included in a separate table, and if the information supplied would be detailed enough, a summary will be
  provided. The search and assessment methodologies (especially the search string, inclusion/exclusion criteria, data
  extraction table, data synthesis and presentation) were adapted following problems overcome, and experience
  gained, during a scoping search.
