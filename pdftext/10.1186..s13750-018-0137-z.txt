What evidence is available on the drivers
of grassland ecosystem stability across a range
of outcome measurements: a systematic map
protocol
Stuart Demmer* , Kevin Kirkman and Michelle Tedder
  Abstract
  Background: Recently there has been considerable focus on the ecosystem services concept which has resulted in
  important advancements in biodiversity conservation across land management scales. Many have, however, cau-
  tioned against the ecosystem services approach because of its focus only on certain aspects of the ecosystem which
  may be unsustainable in the long term. This has encouraged calls for deeper study into ecosystem functioning using
  an holistic ecosystem multifunctionality framework. Here greater biodiversity is thought to facilitate greater function-
  ing leading to more sustainable ecosystems. Although ecosystem multifunctionality is a relatively recent develop-
  ment, the general premise is based on the hypothesis that diversity begets stability. However, several key review
  syntheses have consistently called for ecosystem stability driver-outcome relationship studies to extend beyond tradi-
  tional measurements. Understanding these relationships requires holistic approaches which are often challenging to
  investigate experimentally due to resource constraints. Systematically mapping out the relationships between various
  stability drivers and outcomes could provide a more empirical basis on which both the ecosystem multifunctionality
  and services land management frameworks could be based. This work outlines the protocol for the first systematic
  map which will identify and catalogue diversity–stability related studies within the grassland biome. The outcomes
  of this study will produce a searchable database of the body of literature relevant to the debate and suggest future
  research directions in both empirical and applied ecology fields.
  Methods: Relevant studies will be sourced from online databases. Inclusion criteria will be applied to the returned
  articles to identify studies relevant to the primary question; what evidence is available on the drivers of grassland
  ecosystem stability across a range of outcome measurements. These inclusion criteria will be based on (1) subject
  population—the grassland biome; (2) possible ecosystem stability drivers and comparators (i.e. measures of diver-
  sity, functioning, food web connectedness, and disturbances); and (3) stability outcomes considering all measures
  of ecosystem stability (i.e. coefficients of variation, changes in ecosystem functionality, resistance to disturbances
  and invasions, return rates following disturbance). Studies will be screened for relevance and included articles will be
  critically appraised for meta-analysis and systematic review potential. A narrative synthesis, together with a search-
  able and expandable database, will be compiled to catalogue the relevant studies. Descriptive summary statistics and
  bibliometric network analyses will also be presented.
