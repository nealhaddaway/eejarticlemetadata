Does the amount of trees retained at
clearfelling of temperate and boreal forests
influence biodiversity response?
Katja Fedrowitz* and Lena Gustafsson
  Abstract
  Clear-felling is one of the main methods used in many parts of the world for the production of pulp, timber and
  bioenergy, leading to a simplified forest structure and species composition. One of the measures to mitigate the
  impact of logging on biodiversity is the retention of trees at final harvest. Tree retention approaches in forestry are
  still rather new, although widely distributed across different continents. Several studies have been performed on
  the effects of retention trees on biodiversity but to date there is no evidence on the relation between the amounts
  of trees, i.e. the number, volume or area per ha retained, and the response of biodiversity.
  The overall aim of our review will be to provide forest practitioners and conservationists in temperate and boreal
  forests with more detailed recommendations regarding the amount of trees that should be retained in order to
  achieve positive effects for biodiversity compared to traditional clear-cutting.

  Studies that will be included in the meta-analysis need to have a control group which will be either c) clearfell sites without retention or
