Response of chlorophyll a to total
nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations
in lotic ecosystems: a systematic review protocol
Micah G. Bennett*, Kate A. Schofield, Sylvia S. Lee and Susan B. Norton
  Abstract
  Background: Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a major
  stressor across the globe. Despite recognition by scientists and stakeholders of the problems of nutrient pollution,
  rigorous synthesis of scientific evidence is still needed to inform nutrient-related management decisions, especially
  in streams and rivers. Nutrient stressor-response relationships are complicated by multiple interacting environmental
  factors, complex and indirect causal pathways involving diverse biotic assemblages and food web compartments,
  legacy (historic) nutrient sources such as agricultural sediments, and the naturally high spatiotemporal variability
  of lotic ecosystems. Determining nutrient levels at which ecosystems are affected is a critical first step for identify-
  ing, managing, and restoring aquatic resources impaired by eutrophication and maintaining currently unimpaired
  resources. The systematic review outlined in this protocol will compile and synthesize literature on the response of
  chlorophyll a to nutrients in streams, providing a state-of-the-science body of evidence to assess nutrient impacts to
  one of the most widely-used measures of eutrophication. This review will address two questions: “What is the response
  of chlorophyll a to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in lotic ecosystems?” and “How are these relation-
  ships affected by other factors?”
  Methods: Searches for published and unpublished articles (peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed) will be con-
  ducted using bibliographic databases and search engines. Searches will be supplemented with bibliography searches
  and requests for material from the scientific and management community. Articles will be screened for relevance
  at the title/abstract and full text levels using pre-determined inclusion criteria; 10% (minimum 50, maximum 200)
  of screened papers will be examined by multiple reviewers to ensure consistent application of criteria. Study risk of
  bias will be evaluated using a questionnaire developed from existing frameworks and tailored to the specific study
  types this review will encounter. Results will be synthesized using meta-analysis of correlation coefficients, as well as
  narrative and tabular summaries, and will focus on the shape, direction, strength, and variability of available nutrient-
  chlorophyll relationships. Sensitivity analysis and meta-regression will be used to evaluate potential effects of study
  quality and modifying factors on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships.
