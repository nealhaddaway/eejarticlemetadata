   Abstract
   Systematic mapping assesses the nature of an evidence base, answering how much evidence exists on a particular
   topic. Perhaps the most useful outputs of a systematic map are an interactive database of studies and their meta-data,
   along with visualisations of this database. Despite the rapid increase in systematic mapping as an evidence synthesis
   method, there is currently a lack of Open Source software for producing interactive visualisations of systematic map
   databases. In April 2018, as attendees at and coordinators of the first ever Evidence Synthesis Hackathon in Stock‑
   holm, we decided to address this issue by developing an R-based tool called EviAtlas, an Open Access (i.e. free to use)
   and Open Source (i.e. software code is freely accessible and reproducible) tool for producing interactive, attractive
   tables and figures that summarise the evidence base. Here, we present our tool which includes the ability to generate
   vital visualisations for systematic maps and reviews as follows: a complete data table; a spatially explicit geographical
   information system (Evidence Atlas); Heat Maps that cross-tabulate two or more variables and display the number of
   studies belonging to multiple categories; and standard descriptive plots showing the nature of the evidence base,
   for example the number of studies published per year or number of studies per country. We believe that EviAtlas will
   provide a stimulus for the development of other exciting tools to facilitate evidence synthesis.
