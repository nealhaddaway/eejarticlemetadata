What spatially explicit quantitative
evidence exists that shows the effect of land
tenure on illegal hunting of endangered
terrestrial mammals in sub‑Saharan Africa?
A systematic map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Over the last two decades there has been an increase in the demand for land in Sub Saharan Africa,
  particularly from foreign agribusiness investment to provide food for an increasing human population. The majority
  of land outside of protected areas in sub-Saharan Africa is under customary tenure. Due to poor land administration
  in the region, communities living in undocumented land areas tend to be at greater risk of eviction from increasing
  liberalisation of land markets. To prevent local displacement and disturbance to investment caused by land disputes
  tenure clarification is growing in importance on national and international agendas. Land conversion can fragment
  wildlife habitat while reducing the suitable range areas of terrestrial mammal populations on the continent. Simulta-
  neously illegal hunting is on the rise for a wide variety of taxa driven by a demand for food and income from the sale
  of animal products. To enable a better understanding of how land tenure arrangements impact upon spatial varia-
  tions in illegal hunting, this protocol sets out the parameters for an evidence map which will collate and analyse the
  spatially explicit quantitative evidence that exists showing the effect of land tenure on illegal hunting of endangered
  terrestrial mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region of focus as it contains the highest num-
  ber of terrestrial mammals listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for
  Conservation of Nature. Taking stock of what methods have been used to gather data and where evidence exists can
  guide future research in this area while informing conservation interventions.
  Methods: This evidence map will compare: (1) data availability on the spatial distribution of illicit hunting of endan-
  gered terrestrial mammals across different land tenure regimes in sub-Saharan Africa; (2) research methodologies
  that have primarily been used to collect quantitative data on illegal hunting and comparability of existing data; (3)
  preferences in the research body toward particular taxa and geographical areas, (4) the evidence map will provide an
  analysis on the influence other environmental and anthropogenic determinants that influence the spatial distribution
  of illicit hunting incidences, e.g., proximity to roads, water bodies, range patrol bases etc. Eight academic databases
  and numerous organisation repositories will be searched for relevant studies by three authors. Double screening will
  be carried out on all articles to locate studies that meet the specified inclusion criteria, for inclusion studies must con-
  tain spatially explicit quantitative data on illegal hunting of endangered terrestrial mammals as defined by the Inter-
  national Union for the Conservation of Nature. Relevant information from studies will be extracted to a custom-made
