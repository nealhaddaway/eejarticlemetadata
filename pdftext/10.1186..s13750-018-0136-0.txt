Evidence for the impacts of agroforestry
on agricultural productivity, ecosystem
services, and human well‑being in high‑income
countries: a systematic map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Agroforestry bridges the gap that often separates agriculture and forestry by building integrated
  systems that address both environmental and socio-economic objectives. Agroforestry can improve the resiliency
  of agricultural systems and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Existing research suggests that integrating trees
  on farms can prevent environmental degradation, improve agricultural productivity, increase carbon sequestration,
  generate cleaner water, and support healthy soil and healthy ecosystems while providing stable incomes and other
  benefits to human welfare. Although these claims are becoming more widely accepted as the body of agroforestry
  research increases, systematic understanding of the evidence supporting them remains lacking for high-income
  countries. This systematic map will address this research need by providing a tool for identifying and visualizing the
  existing evidence demonstrating the impacts of agroforestry practices and interventions on agricultural productiv-
  ity, ecosystem services, and human well-being. The results will be useful for informing policy decisions and future
  research by making the evidence easily accessible and highlighting the gaps in knowledge as well as areas with
  enough evidence to conduct systematic reviews.
  Methods: This systematic map will identify, collect, display, and describe available evidence on the impacts of agro-
  forestry on agricultural productivity, ecosystem services, and human well-being in high-income countries. The search
  strategy will cover 5 primary databases and 24 organizational websites using a pre-defined search string designed to
  capture studies relating agroforestry practices and interventions to outcomes in high-income countries. The searches
  will all be conducted in English. We will screen the identified studies for inclusion or exclusion in stages, first on title
  and abstract and then on full-text. We will collect data from studies included at the full-text stage to form the map
  and associated database. For inclusion, the study in question must assess the impacts of the deliberate promotion
  and/or actual integration of woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) on the same land management
  unit as agricultural crops and/or animals.

Intervention type                   Description and examples
Farmer capacity development         Efforts focus on enhancing farmer knowledge and/or skills relevant to agroforestry practice, e.g., setting up and
                                      managing tree nurseries; tree planting and management techniques; and seed collection and propagation. Such
                                      interventions can involve the provision of training, extension and other advisory services, and specific technical
                                      information, as well as the setting up of demonstration sites, running of participatory trials and other modes of
                                      participatory action learning
Material support                    Efforts to facilitate farmer access to quality and desired tree/shrub seedlings/seeds required to pursue prioritized
                                      agroforestry practices. Such interventions often entail the direct provision of seedlings/seeds to farmers but can
                                      also involve linking farmers to relevant suppliers and/or enhancing the ability of existing or new suppliers to supply
                                      participating farmers with quality and desired tree germplasm
Incentive provision                 Interventions of this type seek to motivate farmers to plant trees and practice agroforestry through the provision of
                                      incentives. Examples include paying farmers for planting and caring for trees on their farms in exchange for desired
                                      ecosystem services (e.g. carbon sequestration) and buyers offering premiums to farmers for agricultural commodi-
                                      ties produced under certain conditions (e.g., via certification schemes for products such as shade grown organic
                                      coffee)
Community-level campaigning         Interventions of this type can also involve the provision of information about the benefits of trees and agroforestry
  and advocacy                        and/or the provision tree seedlings/seeds, but this type is distinct from the first two types. The main objective is
                                      to motivate, including through social pressure, community members to plant trees on their farms and/or pursue
                                      specific agroforestry practices. Campaigning and advocacy may be done through radio and/or community meet-
                                      ings, speeches, and drama and may involve a mass community effort to plant trees, for example, on a specific day
                                      of the year
Market linkage facilitation         Interventions of this type focus on efforts to enhance potential returns from agroforestry to encourage adoption. This
                                      could be through linking producers to and/or brokering new and/or improving existing contractual arrangements
                                      with buyers. Other examples include the collective marketing of agroforestry products and/or interventions to
                                      stimulate demand for a given agroforestry product, e.g., pawpaw fruit
Institutional and policy change     Interventions of this type involve reforming and/or putting in place new polices, laws, regulations, and institutions
                                      more broadly to facilitate greater uptake of and benefits from agroforestry. Such efforts are designed to address
                                      existing policy and institutional constraints such as, for example, prevailing forestry regulations—designed for forest
                                      management areas—that may frustrate smallholder efforts to grow particular high-return tree species or insecure
                                      land tenure that may similarly deter long-term investments in tree planting
