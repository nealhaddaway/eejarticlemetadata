What are the effects of the cultivation of GM
herbicide tolerant crops on botanical diversity? A
systematic review protocol
Jeremy Sweet1* and Kaloyan Kostov2
  Abstract
  Background: There are concerns that the cultivation of genetically modified herbicide tolerant (GMHT) crops
  treated with broad spectrum herbicides will cause declines in botanical diversity and hence loss of biodiversity.
  Cultivation systems of these have different levels of inputs and management interventions and some incorporate
  the use of minimal/no tillage. Research results show a range of effects and the priority is to determine whether
  research studies show shifts in botanical diversity and/or declines in plant populations in GMHT compared with
  conventionally managed crops.
  Methods: We will perform a rigorous review of studies of plant populations in fields and field margins of GMHT
  crops by complying with CEE requirements for Systematic Reviews (SR) and the EFSA Guidance on Systematic
  Reviewing. A Review Protocol (RP) is presented for the SR of data from field studies of GMHT crops, comparing the
  effects of GM crop, herbicide regimes and associated management applied to HT crops with conventional crops
  and their weed management for impacts on plant populations in fields and field margins as assessment end points
  or indicators of impacts on botanical diversity and associated food chain and ecosystem services effects. The
  literature search will include all the main GMHT crops including maize, soya, oilseed rape, sugar beet, cotton and
  rice. The keywords will be broad and the search strategy is developed to capture all literature relevant to the
  primary objective of the review. The range of data bases for the searches is described and all articles discovered in
  the searches will be collated by Endnote. The criteria against which studies will be included in the review and how
  they will be assessed are described. They include appropriate study designs, statistical power and comparators. The
  RP outlines the type of analyses that will be performed to assess bias of the selected studies and if covariables
  describing the heterogeneity of the studies introduce biases. Publications meeting the selection criteria will be filed
  separately and subjected to more detailed analysis and data on different plant species and types will be analysed
  separately, to determine outcomes.
