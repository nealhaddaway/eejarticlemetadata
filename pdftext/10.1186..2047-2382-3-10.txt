invertebrates changed by Bt crops compared with
conventional crops? A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Bt crops modified by inserting and expressing the Cry toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis have raised
  environmental concerns over consequences for sustainability of soil biodiversity and ecosystems services in agricultural
  land. Part of this concern is related to the possible effects of the exposure to Cry toxins of non-target soil invertebrates
  as a result of Bt crops cultivation. Soil invertebrate members of microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna play significant
  roles in nutrient cycling and energy flow and thus are crucial for soil ecological functions. In recent years, a number of
  studies have compared the population abundance and biomass of different members of soil biota in fields planted
  with genetically modified Bt crops and their conventional counterparts. In the present systematic review protocol, we
  describe the methodology and quality standards to perform a rigorous literature search and a quantitative synthesis of
  the evidence provided by these studies as required for conducting a Systematic Review.
  Methods: The question that the systematic review will ask is whether populations of soil invertebrates differ
  under Bt crops and conventional crops. Relevant research literature will be collected systematically through a
  comprehensive search strategy. A scoping exercise was performed to identify search terms likely to capture
  appropriate studies and the results were verified using a list of relevant publications as references. The criteria
  against which studies will be included in the review are present, as well as the methodology for the quality
  assessment. To be included the study must contain relevant population abundances or biomass data on soil
  invertebrates exposed to characterised Bt proteins from field studies. The Review Protocol outlines the type of
  analyses that will be performed to assess bias of the selected studies and if covariables describing the
  heterogeneity of the studies introduce bias. Comparative effect sizes irrespective of statistical significance of
  effects will be calculated for individual studies and stored in publicly available databases ready for synthesis of all
  the studies. These treatment effects on population data will be compared across the studies in a meta-analysis
  using Hedges’ g.
