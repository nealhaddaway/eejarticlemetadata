What ecotechnologies exist for recycling
carbon and nutrients from domestic
wastewater? A systematic map protocol

   Abstract
   Background: Pollution of the Baltic Sea continues to be a problem. Major terrestrial sources of nutrient emissions
   to the Baltic Sea are agriculture and wastewater, both major causes of eutrophication. Wastewater contains nutrients
   and organic matter that could constitute valuable products such as agricultural fertilizers and source of energy. With
   the EU’s action plan for circular economy, waste management and resource utilization is central. Thus the integra-
   tion of resource recovery to wastewater management could create benefits beyond the wastewater sector. There is a
   growing interest in resource recovery from wastewater. However, there is no systematic overview of the literature on
   technologies to recover nutrients and carbon from wastewater sources done to date.
   Methods: This systematic map will identify a representative list of studies on ecotechnologies for reusing carbon and
   nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from domestic wastewater, which includes e.g. sewage sludge and wastewater
   fractions. Searches will be performed in five bibliographic databases, one search engine and 38 specialist websites.
   Searches will mainly be performed in English, search for literature in specialist websites will also include Finnish, Polish
   and Swedish. Coding and meta-data extraction will include information on ecotechnology name and short description,
   reuse outcome (i.e. reuse of carbon, nitrogen and/or phosphorus), type of reuse (i.e. whether it is explicit or implicit),
   study country and location, latitude and longitude. All screening and coding will be done after initial consistency check-
   ing. The outcomes of this systematic map will be a searchable database of coded studies. Findings will be presented in a
   geo-informational system (i.e. an evidence atlas) and knowledge gaps and clusters will be visualised via heat maps.
   Keywords: Circular economy, Energy recovery, Nitrogen, Nutrient recovery, Phosphorus, Resource recovery, Sewage
