   Abstract
   Background: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a vital step in limiting climate change and meeting the goals
   outlined in the COP 21 Paris Agreement of 2015. Studies have suggested that agriculture accounts for around 11% of
   total greenhouse gas emissions and the industry has a significant role in meeting international and national climate
   change reduction objectives. However, there is currently little consensus on the mechanisms that regulate the pro-
   duction and assimilation of greenhouse gases in arable land and the practical factors that affect the process. Practical
   advice for farmers is often overly general, and models based on the amount of nitrogen fertiliser applied, for example,
   are used despite a lack of knowledge of how local conditions affect the process, such as the importance of humus
   content and soil types. Here, we propose a systematic map of the evidence relating to the impact on greenhouse gas
   flux from the agricultural management of arable land in temperate regions.
   Methods: Using established methods for systematic mapping in environmental sciences we will search for, collate
   and catalogue research studies relating to the impacts of farming in temperate systems on greenhouse gas emissions.
   We will search 6 bibliographic databases using a tested search string, and will hand search a web-based search engine
   and a list of organisational web sites. Furthermore, evidence will be sought from key stakeholders. Search results will
   then be screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text levels according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria.
   Consistency checking will be employed to ensure the criteria are being applied accurately and consistently. Relevant
   studies will then be subjected to coding and meta-data extraction, which will be used to populate a systematic map
   database describing each relevant study’s settings, methods and measured outcomes. The mapping process will help
   to identify knowledge gaps (subjects lacking in evidence warranting further primary research) and knowledge clus-
   ters (subjects with sufficient studies to allow a useful full systematic review), and will highlight best and suboptimal
   research methods.
