   Abstract
   Background: This systematic review will address the need for a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrain-
   ment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate environ-
   ments. As the number of dams continues to increase worldwide, so too has concerns for their effects on fish popula-
   tions. Fish injury and mortality at hydroelectric facilities may have serious consequences for fish populations, which
   are generally the result of three main sources: (1) fish passage through hydroelectric facilities (i.e., turbines, spillways,
   sluiceways, and other passage routes) during downstream migration for migratory fish; (2) the entrainment of resident
   fish; and (3) the impingement of fish (migratory or resident) against screens/trash racks. Most studies on the impacts
   of entrainment and impingement at hydroelectric facilities on fish have primarily focused on: (1) how fish injury and
   mortality occurs; and (2) evaluations of the effectiveness of various management strategies used to mitigate harm
   during downstream passage. Given the contributions of migratory and resident adults and juveniles to fish produc-
   tion, a necessary extension is to evaluate the impacts of fish injury and mortality from hydropower dam entrainment
   and impingement on fish productivity. Therefore, to ensure the sustainability of fishes dependent on our freshwater
   ecosystems, a better understanding of the impacts of fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelec-
   tric dams on fish productivity is needed.
   Methods: This systematic review will search for, compile, summarize and synthesize evidence on the impacts of
   fish entrainment and impingement associated with hydroelectric dams on fish productivity in freshwater temperate
   environments. Considered studies will include (but not be limited to): (1) those that report a metric related to mortal-
   ity and injury as an indication of the effect on fish productivity; (2) the change in a metric related to mortality and
   injury relative to an appropriate control; and (3) articles that scale-up the evaluation to include some estimate of a
   change in a component of fish productivity (e.g., articles that include an estimate of fish loss from the population due
   to entrainment/impingement by comparing a metric related to mortality or injury to an estimate of population size
   or biomass). Only studies where the causal relationship between intervention and outcome is made clear to allow
   for the effects of entrainment and impingement to be isolated from other potential impacts of hydroelectric power
   production (e.g., barriers to migration and/or habitat degradation), will be included. The review will use public search
   engines and specialist websites, and will include both primary and grey literature. Potential effect modifiers will be
   identified to obtain a better understanding of the factors that are associated with variation in effects among studies,
