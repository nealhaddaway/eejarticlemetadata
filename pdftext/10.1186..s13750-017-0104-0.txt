A five‚Äëstep approach for stakeholder
engagement in prioritisation and planning
of environmental evidence syntheses
Magnus Land*‚Ä† , Biljana Macura‚Ä†, Claes Bernes and Sif Johansson
  Abstract
  Systematic reviews and systematic maps, regarded as a gold standard for syntheses of documented research evi-
  dence, are increasingly used to inform decisions in environmental management. To increase their relevance and
  uptake, systematic reviews and maps can be planned with the help and engagement of stakeholders, i.e. organisa-
  tions and individuals involved in and affected by environmental policy-making and practice. We report on the empri-
  cally tested five-step approach that the Mistra Council for Evidence-based Environmental Management (EviEM) is
  using to engage stakeholders and incorporate their views and opinions in the prioritisation and planning of reviews,
  including (1) stakeholder identification; (2) identification of policy- and practice-relevant topics; (3) framing and
  prioritisation of review questions; (4) establishment of the specific scope of a review; and (5) a public review of a draft
  review protocol. We provide examples from EviEM‚Äôs reviews and describe various challenges and valuable lessons
  learnt from the engagement process, hoping that this will be useful reading not only for reviewers, but also for stake-
  holders who plan to participate in the engagement process.
