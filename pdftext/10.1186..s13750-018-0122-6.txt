   Abstract
   Background: This systematic map protocol responds to an urgent policy need to evaluate key environmental ben‑
   efits of new compulsory greening measures in the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), with the aim
   of building a policy better linked to environmental performance. The systematic map will focus on Ecological Focus
   Areas (EFAs), in which larger arable farmers must dedicate 5% of their arable land to ecologically beneficial habitats,
   landscape features and land uses. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre has used a software tool called
   the ‘EFA calculator’ to inform the European Commission about environmental benefits of EFA implementation. How‑
   ever, there are gaps in the EFA calculator’s coverage of ecosystem services, especially ‘global climate regulation’, and
   an opportunity to use systematic mapping methods to enhance its capture of evidence, in advance of forthcoming
   CAP reforms. We describe a method for assembling a database of relevant, peer-reviewed research conducted in all
   agricultural landscapes in Europe and neighbouring countries with similar biogeography, addressing the primary
   question: what are the impacts of selected EFA features in agricultural land on two policy-relevant ecosystem service
   outcomes—global climate regulation and pollination? The method is streamlined to allow results in good time for the
   current, time-limited opportunity to influence reforms of the CAP greening measures at European and Member State
   level.
   Methods: We will search four bibliographic databases in English, using a predefined and tested search string that
   focuses on a subset of EFA options and ecosystem service outcomes. The options and outcomes are selected as those
   with particular policy relevance and traction. Only articles in English will be included. We will screen search results
   at title, abstract and full text levels, recording the number of studies deemed non-relevant (with reasons at full text).
   A systematic map database that displays the meta-data (i.e. descriptive summary information about settings and
   methods) of relevant studies will be produced following full text assessment. The systematic map database will be
   published as a MS-Excel database. The nature and extent of the evidence base will be discussed, and the applicability
   of methods to convert the available evidence into EFA calculator scores will be assessed.

Randomized                     The EFA feature was allocated randomly to sites, reducing the degree of bias based on initial conditions
Before-and-after trial         Outcomes were monitored before and after the EFA feature was imposed
Quantitative meta-analysis     Results from several studies were collectively analyzed, following critical appraisal, to generate a combined effect size
Model simulation               Outcomes are predicted using simulation models, such as greenhouse gas emission or soil carbon dynamics models
