Much at stake: the importance
of training and capacity building for stakeholder
engagement in evidence synthesis
Jacqualyn Eales1†, Neal R. Haddaway2*† and J. Angus Webb3
  Abstract
  Systematic reviews and maps are complex methods for synthesising evidence that involve specialist and resource-
  intensive activities. Systematic reviewers face challenges when attempting to clearly and precisely communicate
  their methods to end-users and other stakeholder groups. We propose that these challenges are likely to be a key
  causal factor in the generally low uptake of systematic reviews and maps by policy and practitioners in environmen-
  tal science and management. We argue that training and capacity building are inherently important components of
  systematic reviews and maps for all stakeholders; the reviewers themselves, the end-users of specific reviews, and the
  broader research and decision-making community. Training can help to build capacity for undertaking reviews and
  maps, and can help to explain complex methods to stakeholders. Training is important for those wishing to undertake
  stakeholder engagement activities as part of a review. It allows researchers and decision-makers to critique systematic
  reviews and maps based on their methods. Finally, training may be necessary to allow reviewers to prepare visuali-
  sations and communication media for presenting the findings of systematic reviews and maps. We conclude that
  a broad approach, by viewing every opportunity of stakeholder engagement as a potential for training and capac-
  ity building is appropriate both within a specific review and across reviews as a community of practice in evidence
  synthesis. We call for systematic reviewers to improve networks across disciplines in relation to training, sharing
  experiences and course content, and ensuring a consistent approach to capacity building in the conduct and use of
  evidence syntheses.
