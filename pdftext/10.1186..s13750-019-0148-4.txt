   Abstract
   Background: Forests provide an essential resource to the livelihoods of an estimated 20% of the global population.
   The contribution of forest ecosystems and forest-based resources to poverty reduction is increasingly emphasized in
   international policy discourse and conservation and development investments. However, evidence measuring the
   effect of forest-based activities on poverty outcomes remains scattered and unclear. Lack of systematic understanding
   of forest-poverty relationships, in turn, inhibits research, policymaking, and efficient financial resource allocation.
   Methods: To identify relevant studies for inclusion in this systematic map we searched six bibliographic databases, 15
   organizational websites, eight systematic evidence syntheses (reviews and maps), and solicited information from key
   informants. Search results were screened for relevance against predefined inclusion criteria at title, abstract, and full
   text levels, according to a published protocol. Included articles were coded using a predefined framework. Trends in
   the evidence, knowledge gaps and relatively well-researched sub-topics are reported in a narrative synthesis. Occur-
   rence and extent of existing evidence about links between interventions and outcomes are presented in a visual
   heatmap. Data are available through the open access Evidence for Nature and People Data Portal (http://www.natur​
   eandp​eople​evide​nce.org).
   Results: A total of 242 articles were included in the systematic map database. Included articles measured effects
   of 14 forest-based intervention types on 11 poverty dimensions. The majority of the evidence base (72%) examined
   links between productivity-enhancement strategies (e.g. forest management, agroforestry, and habitat management)
   and monetary income and/or social capital outcomes. Other areas with high occurrence of articles include link-
   ages between interventions involving governance, individual rights/empowerment or linked enterprises/livelihood
   alternatives with impacts on monetary income from direct sale of goods. A key knowledge gap was on the impacts
   of investment-based interventions (i.e. enhancing produced, human, and social capitals). Another was the impacts of
   forest-based interventions on financial capital (savings, debt), non-monetary benefits, and health.
   Conclusions: The evidence base on forest-based productive activities and poverty alleviation is growing but displays
   a number of biases in the distribution of articles on key linkages. Priorities for future systematic reviews and evalua-
   tions include in-depth examinations into the impacts of rights-based activities (e.g. governance, empowerment) on
   poverty dimensions; and productivity-enhancing activities on social capital. More comprehensive and robust evi-
   dence is needed to better understand the synergies and trade-offs among the different objectives of forest conserva-
   tion and management and variation in outcomes for different social groups in different social-ecological contexts.
