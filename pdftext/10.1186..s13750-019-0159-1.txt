Bridging Indigenous and science‑based
knowledge in coastal‑marine research,
monitoring, and management in Canada:
a systematic map protocol

   Abstract
   Background: The incorporation of multiple types of knowledge (e.g., science, Indigenous knowledge, traditional
   ecological knowledge) is an important undertaking, which can strengthen the evidence-base for policy advice, deci-
   sion making, and environmental management. While the benefits of incorporating multiple types of knowledge in
   environmental research and management are many, successfully doing so has remained a challenge. In response
   there has been a number of recent reviews that have sought to better understand the what and how, when it comes
   to bridging Indigenous and science-based knowledge. Yet there continues to be a need for methods, models, and
   approaches for integrative work. This systematic map seeks to examine the extent, range, and nature of the published
   literature (i.e., peer-reviewed and grey) that integrates and/or includes Indigenous and science-based knowledge in
   coastal-marine research, monitoring, or management in Canada. Results from this study can be used to inform new
   and ongoing research and monitoring efforts and highlight evidence gaps.
   Methods: The systematic map will aim to capture all available studies relevant to the question found in the peer-
   reviewed and grey literature. Accordingly, the search will leverage four databases focused on peer reviewed publica-
   tions, carefully selected specialist websites, and two web-based search engines. Reference sections of relevant review
   articles will also be cross-checked to identify articles that were not found using the search strategy. All searches will be
   conducted in English. Search results will be reviewed in two stages: (1) title and abstract; and (2) full text. All screening
   decisions will be included in the database. The systematic map will employ a narrative synthesis approach that will
   include the use of descriptive statistics, tables (including SM database), and figures (including map with the studies
   geospatially referenced). In addition, an online version of the map and queryable database will be developed similar
   to other knowledge mobilization tools.
