Scientific evidence for sustainable plant
disease protection strategies for the main arable
crops in Sweden. A systematic map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Efficient and sustainable plant protection is of great economic and ecological significance for global
  crop production. A number of challenges, e.g. climate change, population growth and global trade, put increasing
  demands on future crop production and crop protection. This necessitates an increase in crop productivity with less
  environmental impact while maintaining good food quality and food security. To meet these challenges, it is essential
  that the recommendations provided to growers are efficient and correct, which can only be ensured by evidence-
  based recommendations based on outcomes from scientific studies.
  Methods and output: The aim of these systematic maps is to compile scientific evidence for different plant disease
  protection strategies for the main arable crops grown in Sweden. Six major crops (wheat, barley, oat, potato, sugar
  beet and oilseed rape) have been selected based on the area under production, the annual production, the economic
  importance, and the amount of pesticide used against diseases in these crops in Sweden. All methods to manage
  diseases will be considered, including cropping system, pesticide application, biological control methods, as well as
  combinations of methods and integrated pest management. These systematic maps will only deal with field studies
  of relevance for agricultural practices in Sweden, although we expect that the results will be applicable for northern
  Europe as a whole. The main outcome to be used will be productivity measured as yield per area. Plant health and
  pathogen reduction will be included as a proxy for potential increase in crop quality and yield. This will provide a
  systematic overview of the plant disease protection measures that have been reported in the scientific literature. The
  study will result in one searchable database per crop that may be used as a catalogue of evidence for researchers
  and stakeholders, especially authorities and advisory organizations. The systematic maps will aid in the identification
  of areas that need further research and guide funding agencies and policymakers when deciding where research
  resources should be allocated. It will also help to select topics for future systematic reviews and meta-studies within
  the field of plant protection.
