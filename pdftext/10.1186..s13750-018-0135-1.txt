  Abstract
  Background: Along with climate change, herbivory is considered a main driver of ecosystem change in terres-
  trial Arctic environments. Understanding how herbivory influences the resilience of Arctic ecosystems to ongoing
  environmental changes is essential to inform policy and guide sustainable management practices. However, many
  studies indicate that the effects of herbivores on plants and ecosystem functioning depend on the abiotic and biotic
  conditions where the interaction takes place, i.e. the ecological context. Yet, the range of ecological contexts in which
  herbivory has been studied in the Arctic has not been systematically assessed. A lack of such evaluation prevents
  understanding the robustness and generalizability of our knowledge of Arctic herbivore effects on vegetation and
  ecosystems. The main objective of our systematic map is to identify the ecological contexts where herbivory is
  studied in the Arctic. Hence, this systematic map will enable us to assess our ability to make generalizable and robust
  conclusions regarding the impacts of Arctic herbivory.
  Methods: We will search academic and grey literature using databases, search engines and specialist websites, and
  select studies addressing the response of the plant(s) to herbivory, deemed relevant in terms of (i) population (ter-
  restrial Arctic plants and plant communities), (ii) exposure (herbivory, including disturbance and fertilization effects of
  herbivores), and (iii) modifier (ecological context being in the terrestrial Arctic including forest-tundra). We will synthe-
  size the results using systematic mapping approaches.
