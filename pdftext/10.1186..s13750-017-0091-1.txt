What evidence exists on the impact
of agricultural practices in fruit orchards
on biodiversity indicator species groups? A
systematic map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Biodiversity loss, due in part to intensification of agriculture, has become a global issue. In this context,
  fruit producers are looking for nature-friendly production methods. Their aim is to reduce intensive pesticide use and
  to enhance orchard management in terms of optimising habitats for beneficial organisms. However, fruit production,
  especially in low-stem orchards, requires several interventions over the course of the year (tillage, thinning, mowing,
  disking, spraying, fertilisation, etc.), each of them representing a disturbance. Surprisingly, international journals seem
  to contain few publications on the impact of most of these practices (except pesticides) on biodiversity in general
  and beneficial organisms in particular, even though the benefits of predators to control pests have been known for
  decades. However, an increasing number of studies have been published in the past 10 years, corroborating the
  importance that biodiversity has gained as a topic in life cycle assessment. In this context, an expert system that con-
  siders the impact of individual farming activities on a set of biodiversity indicators (flora of crops and grasslands, birds,
  mammals, amphibians, slugs and snails, spiders, carabids, butterflies, wild bees, and grasshoppers) is to be extended
  to practices in low-stem and high-stem orchards. We therefore intend to conduct a systematic map to assess what
  evidence exists on the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity indicator species groups.
  Methods and output: By gathering this information, we aim (a) to assess the state of research on discrete indicators
  and/or practices, (b) to identify literature relevant for assessing production impact and habitat suitability and (c) to
  provide a wide-ranging overview of existing evidence and its transfer to extension services and public perception. A
  literature search in scientific journals, agronomy magazines and the internet will therefore be performed in English,
  German and French. Following article screening, included articles will be recorded and coded (per the results of a
  limited study quality assessment). The resulting database and maps will be presented along with descriptive statistics
  of the distribution and abundance of evidence across interventions and outcomes.
