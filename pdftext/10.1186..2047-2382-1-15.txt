crease the problems listed above. Alternatively the pro-
motion of a synthetic approach to policy-relevant
science might improve the evidence base and provide a
more objective measure of the impact of individual
papers.
   The value and credibility of science is undermined by
examples such as those given above. Translation of sci-
ence to inform policy should be an ordered process with
rules to minimise bias equivalent to those established for
primary research. In environmental sciences it seems we
are still being encouraged to engage in an entrepreneur-
ial free-for-all effort to promote individual studies to the
policy community, a state that the health scientists have
fought against for some 20 years. Are we going to learn                                Submit your next manuscript to BioMed Central
