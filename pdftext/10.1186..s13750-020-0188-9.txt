   Abstract
   Background: Voluntary Sustainability Standards and ecolabels are market-based mechanisms used to encour-
   age producers and consumers toward environmental sustainability. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) aims to
   improve ocean health and promote a sustainable seafood market. There is growing interest in the program’s impacts
   (direct and indirect) from changes to fisheries management and consumer awareness to market access and the
   reputation of fisheries. To better understand what is known about the program’s impacts and the quality of evidence
   available, this map collates and describes articles on the environmental, social, institutional and economic effects of
   the MSC, identifying the methods used to determine impacts, and highlighting knowledge gaps and clusters.
   Methods: Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches of peer-reviewed literature were conducted in Web
   of Science, SCOPUS and AGRIS. Grey literature was gathered from Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and three
   subject-specific websites. A total of 771 articles were retrieved, 271 of which were screened at full-text. 28 articles met
   all inclusion criteria and a further 37 met all the criteria but did not have a comparator. Additionally, 108 articles that
   describe the MSC but do not investigate its impacts (thus failing on ‘comparator’ and ‘outcome’ inclusion criteria) were
   included in the narrative report. This provides an overview of MSC topics that are of general interest to researchers in
   comparison to articles that investigate MSC’s impact.
   Results: Evidence of the impact of MSC certification fall in the following topic categories: economic (38%), envi-
   ronmental (25%), governance (29%) and social (8%). These articles documented diverse outcomes related to MSC
   certification. The most common are price premiums, market access, changes in stock health, ecosystem impacts and
   fisheries management changes. A key knowledge gap are articles on the effects of the MSC’s Chain of Custody Stand-
   ard and its effects on the supply chain. Generally, literature focused on European and North American fisheries with
   little focus on fisheries situated in lower-income countries.
   Conclusions: Research interest in the MSC has grown over the last two decades, however, little research uses study
   designs and evidence that can robustly detect or attribute change to the MSC. Greater focus on conducting robust
   quasi-experimental designs would help to better understand the program effects. Comparing areas of interest in the
   general literature (which, for example, shows greater focus on the governance aspects of the programme than found
   in literature using comparators) suggests that this is partly due to lack of resources, data access and the challenge
   of obtaining counterfactuals. Nevertheless, some topics were absent in all areas, such as the social and economic
   dynamics that link harvesters and supply chain actors. It is important to fill the identified knowledge gaps as the
