  Abstract
  Background: There is an urgent need to ensure that food production is maintained in response to either a reduction
  in use or lack of availability of natural resources. To this end, several strategies have been investigated to determine
  which agronomic approaches may improve crop yields under conditions of reduced water and/or nutrients provision,
  with special attention upon nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). New technologies and practices have been developed
  for key commercial crops, such as tomatoes. However, few of these are widely adopted in the field and evidence of
  their value in this production setting is limited.
  Methods: This protocol sets out a systematic map methodology that aims to provide a coherent synthesis of the
  available evidence among the literature on the techniques and management approaches that may ensure the
  productivity of field-grown tomatoes under conditions of water-, N- and/or P-deficits, either as single or combined
  stresses. To conduct the literature search, a search strategy was produced to define the scope of the systematic map
  and to allow reproducibility of the approach. A list of published and unpublished sources of literature were selected
  and a preliminary trial identified best-fit-for-purpose search-terms and -strings. A literature screening process was set
  with consistency checks amongst reviewers at the title, abstract and full text screening stages. A series of eligibility
  criteria were defined to ensure objectivity and consistency in the selection of studies that are best suited to address
  the research question of the systematic map. In addition, a coding strategy was designed to set the means for meta-
  data extraction out from the literature for review. A drafted structured questionnaire will serve as the base for collating
  the meta-data to produce a database where variables will be queried for the evidence synthesis. This work is expected
  to inform stakeholders, researchers and policy makers regarding the extent and nature of the existing evidence base,
  and so serve as a basis by-which specific approaches may be highlighted as potential focal-areas in future.
