Does structural connectivity facilitate movement
of native species in Australia’s fragmented
landscapes?: a systematic review protocol
Erik D Doerr1,2*, Veronica AJ Doerr1,2, Micah J Davies1 and Heather M McGinness1
  Abstract
  Background: Habitat fragmentation and accompanying isolation effects are among the biggest threats to global
  biodiversity. The goal of restoring connectivity to offset these threats has gained even greater urgency under the
  looming spectre of climate change. While linear corridors have been the most commonly proposed solution to
  these issues, it has become increasingly recognised that structural connectivity exists in different forms with a variety of
  characteristics. We previously conducted a systematic review from 2008-2010 to collate and synthesise evidence
  regarding the relationship between these different types of structural connectivity and the actual movement of
  native Australian plants and animals (i.e., functional connectivity). Our previous review produced a number of
  management recommendations but also identified significant knowledge gaps. Given that empirical research into
  connectivity has become even more common since the original review and that it has been more than five years
  since the original literature searches, the time is ripe for an update of that review.
  Methods: We will update our previous systematic review by repeating a thorough search for both published and
  unpublished evidence on the effects of structural connectivity on animal and plant movement through heterogeneous
  landscapes. We will slightly broaden the scope of the original review by including data on semi-aquatic species
  as well as terrestrial ones. Studies will be included if they: 1) contain data on a terrestrial or semi-aquatic native
  Australian species; 2) have at least one study site that contains some form of structural connectivity between
  otherwise isolated patches of habitat; and 3) include data on movement of species through the connectivity or
  data that allow inference of movement (or the lack thereof). We will repeat the analyses carried out for the original
  review which used hierarchical linear modelling to assess the effects of numerous sources of heterogeneity (e.g., type
  of connectivity, width of connection, ecosystem type, taxonomic group, and many other characteristics of the species,
  habitat, and connectivity) on the amount of movement observed in a landscape. If increased sample sizes allow we will
  also carry out additional meta-analyses, which were not possible with the original dataset.

the animals are moving. In some studies, the movement is even experimentally induced. Thus, we will include all studies with evidence of inter-patch movement,
regardless of whether the purpose of the movement is known. Where the purpose of the movement is known but is related to migration or even daily foraging
