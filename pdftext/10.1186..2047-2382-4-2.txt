What are ‚ÄòIntegrated Landscape Approaches‚Äô and
how effectively have they been implemented in
the tropics: a systematic map protocol
James Reed*, Liz Deakin and Terry Sunderland
  Abstract
  Background: There is an increasing acceptance that sectorial approaches to land management are no longer
  sufficient to meet global challenges such as poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and food production. The
  pressing challenge of integrated landscape management is to link agricultural practices, institutions and policies
  with other landscape-scale activities. ‚ÄúIntegrated Landscape Approaches‚Äù provide a basic framework for balancing
  competing demands and integrating policies for multiple land uses within a given area. However, attempts to
  formalize and characterize what landscape approaches actually represent have resulted in a plethora of interlinked
  terminology and re-invention of ideas and practices under multiple guises. This has led to delayed uptake amongst
  policy makers and resistance to implementation on the ground. This protocol will describe the methodology to be
  employed for a systematic map that will chart the development of the landscape approach theory, consolidate and
  synthesize existing definitions, and identify where and how these approaches have been implemented in the
  humid and dry tropics.
  Methods/Design: A scoping exercise gave rise to a selection of search terms appropriate to the research question
  which will then be applied to a suite of specialist, online and institutional databases. The protocol will follow a
  population-intervention-comparator-outcome (P.I.C.O) framework which provides the basic rationale for evidence-based
  systematic literature searches. The P.I.C.O serves as the inclusion criteria and together with a pre-determined exclusion
  criteria will be used to screen retrieved literature for relevance at title, abstract and full text levels. All studies investigating
  either landscape approach theory or implementation within the humid and dry tropics will be included. The resulting
  studies will be coded and used to satisfy two key outcomes. First, literature on the theory of landscape-scale approaches
  will be compared and contrasted to identify where overlap and disjuncture exists. Second, studies of landscape approach
  implementation will be assessed for effectiveness, geographically mapped, made available in searchable databases and
  supplemented with a full report.
