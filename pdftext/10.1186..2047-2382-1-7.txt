What are the effects of macroalgal blooms on the
structure and functioning of marine ecosystems?
A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Anthropogenic activities are believed to have caused an increase in the magnitude, frequency, and
  extent of macroalgal blooms in marine and estuarine environments. These blooms may contribute to declines in
  seagrasses and non-blooming macroalgal beds, increasing hypoxia, and reductions in the diversity of benthic
  invertebrates. However, they may also provide other marine organisms with food and habitat, increase secondary
  production, and reduce eutrophication. The objective of this systematic review will be to quantify the positive and
  negative impacts of anthropogenically induced macroalgal blooms in order to determine their effects on
  ecosystem structure and functioning, and to identify factors that cause their effects to vary.
  Methods: We will search a number of online databases to gather empirical evidence from the literature on the
  impacts of macroalgal blooms on: (1) species richness and other univariate measures of biodiversity; (2) productivity
  and abundance of algae, plants, and animals; and (3) biogeochemical cycling and other flows of energy and
  materials, including trophic interactions and cross-ecosystem subsidies. Data from relevant studies will be extracted
  and used in a random effects meta-analysis in order to estimate the average effect of macroalgal blooms on each
  response of interest. Where possible, sub-group analyses will be conducted in order to evaluate how the effects of
  macroalgal blooms vary according to: (1) which part of the ecosystem is being studied (e.g. which habitat type,
  taxonomic group, or trophic level); (2) the size of blooms; (3) the region in which blooms occurred; (4) background
  levels of ecosystem productivity; (5) physical and chemical conditions; (6) aspects of study design and quality (e.g.
  lab vs. field, experimental vs. observational, degree of replication); and (7) whether the blooms are believed to be
  anthropogenically induced or not.
