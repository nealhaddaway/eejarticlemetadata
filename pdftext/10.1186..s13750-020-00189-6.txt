   Abstract
   Background: The Baltic Sea ecosystems supply many benefits to society, termed ecosystem services. These depend
   upon a healthy marine environment requiring marine and relevant land-based policies integrated with public health
   policies. Until recently marine environment protection policies have largely focussed on human impacts on the
   environment and have not taken into account impacts of ecosystems on human health beyond the direct impacts
   of hazardous substances, such as those present in seafood. Whilst endeavours have been made to integrate human
   health and well-being into marine policies, interviews with key stakeholders through a participatory process revealed
   that the linkages were not sufficiently strong to inform policymaking. The existing evidence base urgently needs to
   be identified and synthesised to support relevant policy updates of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD)
   2008/56/EC and the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) (2007) as well as to help direct future research priorities.
   Method: The protocol is based on the primary question, “What linkages have been researched between Baltic Sea eco-
   systems and the positive and negative impacts to human health and well-being?” Using systematic mapping, this study
   will identify and map the state and the geographical distribution of the existing research evidence linking human
   health and well-being with the Baltic Sea ecosystems. The types of ecosystem services supplied by the Baltic Sea and
   the associated health and well-being impacts will be categorised and presented in a graphical matrix, illustrating eco-
   system service type and the types of health and well-being outcomes. The systematic mapping procedure will result
   in a narrative report published with a searchable database, which will contain a descriptive summary of the informa-
   tion from all of the eligible studies. The systematic map and database will be displayed on the website of the Finnish
   Environment Institute (SYKE).
