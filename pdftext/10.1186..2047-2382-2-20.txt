Do mangrove forest restoration or rehabilitation
activities return biodiversity to pre-impact levels?
Dominic A Andradi-Brown1*, Caroline Howe2, Georgina M Mace2 and Andrew T Knight1,3
  Abstract
  Background: Mangrove forest restoration and rehabilitation programs are increasingly undertaken to re-establish
  ecosystem services in the context of community-based biodiversity conservation. Restoration is returning a habitat
  to the most natural condition, whereas rehabilitation often focuses on optimising ecosystem services alongside
  biodiversity. With many different restoration and rehabilitation objectives and techniques existing, it is difficult to
  assess the general effectiveness of restoration and rehabilitation on biodiversity and ecosystem services. This
  systematic review protocol presents a methodology that will be used to assess the impacts of mangrove forest
  restoration and rehabilitation on biodiversity and provisioning ecosystem services in a global context.
  Methods: This review will assess studies that have undertaken biodiversity surveys of restored and rehabilitated
  mangrove forests by comparing them against suitable mature reference mangrove forests within the same region,
  or surveys prior to degradation of the forest. This review will investigate how the age and initial tree diversity of a
  restoration or rehabilitation activities determine the effectiveness of these initiatives. Taxa of commercial value to
  local communities will be assessed to identify whether rehabilitation for optimal ecosystem service provision is
  likely to conflict with the full restoration of mangrove forests.
