   Abstract
   Systematic reviews and systematic maps represent powerful tools to identify, collect, evaluate and summarise primary
   research pertinent to a specific research question or topic in a highly standardised and reproducible manner. Even
   though they are seen as the “gold standard” when synthesising primary research, systematic reviews and maps are
   typically resource-intensive and complex activities. Thus, managing the conduct and reporting of such reviews can
   become a time consuming and challenging task. This paper introduces the open access online tool CADIMA, which
   was developed through a collaboration between the Julius Kühn-Institut and the Collaboration for Environmental Evi-
   dence, in order to increase the efficiency of the evidence synthesis process and facilitate reporting of all activities to
   maximise methodological rigour. Furthermore, we analyse how CADIMA compares with other available tools by pro-
   viding a comprehensive summary of existing software designed for the purposes of systematic review management.
   We show that CADIMA is the only available open access tool that is designed to: (1) assist throughout the systematic
   review/map process; (2) be suited to reviews broader than medical sciences; (3) allow for offline data extraction; and,
   (4) support working as a review team.
