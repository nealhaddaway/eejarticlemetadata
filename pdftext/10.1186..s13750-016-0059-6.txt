A methodology for systematic mapping
in environmental sciences
Katy L. James1, Nicola P. Randall1* and Neal R. Haddaway2
   Abstract
   Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering ques-
   tions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of
   interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead
   collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a
   topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions,
   knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be
   suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces
   similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping meth-
   odology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for
   systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting
   the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publica-
   tion; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal
   (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the
   similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guid-
   ance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the
   merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in
   environmental sciences.
