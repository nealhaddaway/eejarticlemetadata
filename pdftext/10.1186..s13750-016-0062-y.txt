ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia: a systematic
review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Alien species are severely impacting the environment, public health and socioeconomy at a global
  scale. Their management is thus of crucial importance and the subject of intensive research efforts. Common rag-
  weed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. is an alien species with negative impacts on agriculture, human health and biodiver-
  sity. It is a highly allergenic, wind-pollinated herb native to North America that was first introduced to Europe during
  the seventeenth century. It has since become widespread and is currently in an ongoing phase of rapid spread and
  increasing abundance. Several management approaches are currently implemented and effective control of the
  species can have strong socioeconomic benefits. However, evidence for management effectiveness is scattered and
  has not yet been synthesised systematically. For these reasons, we here aim to systematically review the evidence to
  assess (a) what is the effectiveness of management options used for control of Common ragweed Ambrosia artemisii-
  folia and (b) what is the effect of confounding factors such as habitat, climate and frequency and timing of treatment?
  Methods: This protocol specifies the methods for conducting a systematic review to answer the specified questions.
  Search terms relating to the population and the intervention (type of management) will be combined and searched
  in a range of databases and other sources. Specific inclusion criteria are (i) any population of Ambrosia artemisiifolia at
  any habitat including populations in agricultural settings and such used for experimental research at any geographic
  location (including its native range), (ii) any physical, chemical, biological or combined management action; (iii) direct
  outcome measures including change in coverage, abundance, biomass, survival, reoccurrence, biology (e.g. growth,
  height, leaf area) or pollen production. The wide range of quality of primary literature will be evaluated with a tailored
  system for assessing susceptibility to bias and the reliability of the studies. If extracted data are suitable for quantita-
  tive synthesis, we aim to calculate effect sizes and conduct meta-analyses.
