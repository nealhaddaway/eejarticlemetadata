Lessons for introducing stakeholders
to environmental evidence synthesis
Jessica J. Taylor1,2,3*, Trina Rytwinski1,2,3, Joseph R. Bennett1,3 and Steven J. Cooke1,2,3
   Abstract
   Involving stakeholders in systematic reviews is common practice and is advised in the Collaboration for Environmen-
   tal Evidence (CEE) Guidelines (v.4.2). Frameworks for engaging stakeholders exist and should be used; however, there
   are additional lessons to be learned in a country, or region where evidence-based environmental management is an
   emerging paradigm. Based on our experience working with Canadian governmental institutions, we provide five les-
   sons that we have learned while introducing stakeholders to the CEE systematic review (hereafter SR) process. These
   lessons are: (1) Advocate for a systematic review with broad geographical scope and target audience; (2) Control
   stakeholder mission-creep; (3) Establish a mutually beneficial timeline; (4) Reduce the potential of biased targeted
   searches; and (5) Manage stakeholder expectations. By incorporating these lessons into existing frameworks, we hope
   to make the introduction of SRs to stakeholders more efficient to conserve resources and maintain long-lasting, pro-
   ductive relationships between the review team and stakeholders.
