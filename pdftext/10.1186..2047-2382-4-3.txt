What is the effect of phasing out long-chain
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the
concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their
precursors in the environment? A systematic
review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
  substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made
  substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than
  60 years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not
  known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide
  diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However,
  the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental
  degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the
  environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review
  may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are
  changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the
  concentration trends.
  Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in
  the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples
  include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language
  or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of
  about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests
  will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors
  (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples,
  sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal
  concentration trends.
