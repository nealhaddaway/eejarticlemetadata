What is the impact of kelp forest density and/or
area on fisheries?

  Abstract
  Background: Kelp forests are highly productive ecosystem engineers of rocky cold-water marine coastlines,
  providing shelter, habitat and food for a variety of associated organisms. Several factors have been related with an
  observed trend of kelp deforestation in some regions of the globe. The effect of this trend on fisheries has been
  poorly studied. The European directives addressing the conservation of marine habitats highlight the need to
  increase the knowledge about the relationship between kelp forests and fisheries, which will also be very valuable
  for the definition of fisheries management measures. This protocol describes the methods that will be used to
  conduct a systematic review to answer the following question: What is the impact of changes in kelp forest density
  and/or area on the abundance and diversity of fisheries?
  Methods/design: This systematic review will be focused primary in studies that report on positive, negative or no
  quantitative relationships between kelp forests (abundance and/or presence) and the health of fisheries (including
  adults and young life stages). The measurement of fisheries health will include abundance, presence and diversity
  of fisheries, mortality, fertility and recruitment rates and feeding behavior.
