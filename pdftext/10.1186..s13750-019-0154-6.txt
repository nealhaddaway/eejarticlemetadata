Examining the efficacy of anti‑predator
training for increasing survival in conservation
translocations: a systematic review protocol
Alison L. Greggor1*, Catherine J. Price2 and Debra M. Shier1
   Abstract
   Background: How animals respond to predators can have consequences when they are reintroduced into the wild
   or translocated to new habitats. Animals raised in captivity often lack adequate experience with predators, and wild
   animals can be ill-equipped to respond to invasive predators. When these animals are released or translocated for
   conservation purposes, their naivety can jeopardize their survival and the outcome of the conservation interven-
   tion. Anti-predator training, i.e. the purposeful exposure of animals to predators or predatory-like cues for promoting
   predatory learning and awareness, is often suggested to be a useful tool in combating prey naivety. However, the
   prevalence of such training and the evidence for its effectiveness in conservation settings are currently unknown. We
   detail a set of protocols aimed at resolving both of these unknowns.
   Methods: We will aim to gather studies from multiple databases and grey literature sources which document the
   occurrence of anti-predator training. We will search beyond the conservation management literature to also cover
   interventions aimed at promoting anti-predator behaviour in commercial contexts and other academic fields (e.g.
   animal cognition, behavioral ecology). Studies will be screened in two phases. The first stage of screening will collect
   studies that conduct anti-predator training. Metadata from this stage will help highlight biases in the use of anti-
   predator training across geographic locations, funding contexts and taxonomic groups. We will then further screen for
   research that measures training efficacy either by using learning assessments, designating experimental groups, or by
   collecting post-release survival data. A narrative synthesis at this stage will describe the relative proportion of studies
   that measure the efficacy of their training. The smaller research pool will then be systematically reviewed to assess the
   efficacy of anti-predator training. We will attempt to extract data from all studies which assess efficacy, judging study
   validity and conducting a meta-analysis if sufficient evidence is found. By creating two stages to our screening and
   review of evidence, we will be able to better judge the biases and reliability of the efficacy evidence we find.
