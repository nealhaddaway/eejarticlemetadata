   Abstract
   The first international Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) conference took place in August 2016 at the
   Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm with nearly 100 participants from 14 countries. This conference
   reflected and contributed to the growth of a global network of people interested in the production and use of
   evidence syntheses in environmental management. The conference also provided an opportunity to identify emerg-
   ing themes and reflect on those ideas and perspectives to help direct future activities of the CEE and the broader
   community. An increasingly engaged community of practice was evident but there is uneven distribution of experi-
   ence, resources, capacity, and commitment to evidence synthesis in different sectors and regions. There is much
   opportunity to bring academics, practitioners, and other partners together which will help to further demonstrate
   impact of evidence synthesis activities and enhance relevance. As the discipline evolves there is growing interest in
   rapid evidence synthesis but the benefits and risks of that approach remain unclear. There was also a recognition that
   improvements in empirical science will enhance the likelihood that more studies can be fully exploited as part of
   evidence synthesis. There are opportunities for capacity building, engaging the next generation (e.g., students), and
   enhancing connections within and beyond the CEE community to advance evidence-based environmental manage-
   ment. It is our desire that this paper will serve as a template for future CEE activities (i.e., where to invest resources) but
   also as an invitation to those that were unable to attend to participate in CEE and the evidence-based environmental
   management movement in whichever ways resonate with them.
