What is the influence on water quality in
temperate eutrophic lakes of a reduction of
planktivorous and benthivorous fish?
A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: In lakes that have become eutrophic due to sewage discharges or nutrient runoff from land,
  problems such as algal blooms and oxygen deficiency often persist even when nutrient supplies have been
  reduced. One reason is that phosphorus stored in the sediments can exchange with the water. There are
  indications that the high abundance of phytoplankton, turbid water and lack of submerged vegetation seen in
  many eutrophic lakes may represent a semi-stable state. For that reason, a shift back to more natural clear-water
  conditions could be difficult to achieve.
  In some cases, though, temporary mitigation of eutrophication-related problems has been accomplished through
  biomanipulation: stocks of zooplanktivorous fish have been reduced by intensive fishing, leading to increased
  populations of phytoplankton-feeding zooplankton. Moreover, reduction of benthivorous fish may result in lower
  phosphorus fluxes from the sediments. An alternative to reducing the dominance of planktivores and benthivores
  by fishing is to stock lakes with piscivorous fish. These two approaches have often been used in combination.
  The implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive has recently led to more stringent demands for
  measures against eutrophication, and a systematic review could clarify whether biomanipulation is efficient as a
  measure of that kind.
  Methods: The review will examine primary field studies of how large-scale biomanipulation has affected water
  quality and community structure in eutrophic lakes or reservoirs in temperate regions. Such studies can be based
  on comparison between conditions before and after manipulation, on comparison between treated and non-
  treated water bodies, or both. Relevant outcomes include Secchi depth, concentrations of oxygen, nutrients,
  suspended solids and chlorophyll, abundance and composition of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish, and
  coverage of submerged macrophytes.
