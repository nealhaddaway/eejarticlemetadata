What are the environmental impacts
of property rights regimes in forests, fisheries
and rangelands?

   Abstract
   Background: Property rights to natural resources comprise a major policy instrument in efforts to advance sustain-
   able resource use and conservation. Debate over the relative effectiveness of different property rights regimes in
   reaching these goals remains controversial. A large, diverse, and rapidly growing body of literature investigates the
   links between property rights regimes and environmental outcomes, but has not synthesized theoretical and policy
   insights within specific resource systems and especially across resource systems.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review following CEE Guidelines in which we collected empirical evidence
   from the past two decades on the environmental impacts of property rights regimes in fisheries, forests and range-
   lands in developing countries. We used a bundle of rights approach to assess the impacts of state, private, and com-
   munity property regimes, as well as mixed regimes and open access conditions. Outcomes were classified as positive,
   negative, neutral or undetermined. We also collected information on contextual and other factors thought to influ-
   ence effect of property rights regimes on environmental outcomes. The search covered 90 online databases and three
   languages, resulting in a total of 34,984 screened titles.
   Results: This review identified 103 articles consisting of 374 property regime studies: 55% of the studies related to
   forestry, 31% to fisheries, and 14% to rangelands. The majority of the studies comprised case–control studies but
   presented limited information on the baseline condition of the resource system. Only 26 studies used before-after-
   control-impact (BACI) design. We found that property regime comparisons differed across resource domains with, for
   example, the majority of fisheries studies using comparison to an open access situation while forest and rangeland
   studies were more mixed in regime comparisons. After critical appraisal of included studies, only 80 studies were
   accepted for the narrative synthesis. The key contextual factors largely associated with reported positive environmen-
   tal outcomes across the three resource systems included monitoring and enforcement systems, resource use pres-
   sure, and the presence or absence of clear, stable and legitimate rights (i.e. ‘positive regime characteristics’).
   Conclusions: A key overall finding was that the evidence base was insufficiently robust to draw consistent conclu-
   sions about the environmental impacts of different property rights regimes within or across resource systems. The
   majority of studies reported that any regime is likely to perform better than an open access regime, whereas the
   performance of state, community, private and mixed regimes was much more ambiguous. Future research on prop-
   erty rights regimes would benefit from more rigorous study designs and more cohesive multidisciplinary research
   methods. In particular, studies emphasizing a natural science approach could better describe property rights regime
   characteristics and contextual factors while contributions by teams with a stronger social science emphasis should
   take care to provide more rigorous empirical data on environmental outcomes.

                                                 described, it was noted as undefined
                                               Rights were defined as de jure when this was explicitly mentioned by authors. For example for
                                                 community regimes, this required that the article mentioned specific rules and laws, formal state

 Distribution of bundle of rights (de facto)   Rights were noted as state, community, private, open access or undefined
                                               Rights were defined as de facto if there was no explicit reference to formal rules or regulations. For
