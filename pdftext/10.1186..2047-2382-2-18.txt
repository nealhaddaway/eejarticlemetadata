Environmental impacts of farm land abandonment
in high altitude/mountain regions: a systematic
map of the evidence
Neal R Haddaway1, David Styles2 and Andrew S Pullin1*
  Abstract
  Background: Environmental impacts of farm land abandonment can be viewed as either an opportunity for
  ecological restoration to a state prior to agricultural establishment, or as the loss of an on-going process of land
  management and an associated threat to biodiversity. Whether land abandonment poses an ecological opportunity
  or threat depends upon the agricultural history and the presence of ecological systems that depend upon regular
  management for their existence. In Europe, many ecosystems have developed in the presence of agriculture and
  the loss of continued management resulting from land abandonment can have significant negative ecological
  impacts. Around 56 percent of the utilised agricultural area (UAA) of the EU is classified as ‘less-favourable areas’
  and much of this is mountainous. The small-scale and extensively managed farmlands that are common in
  mountain areas are particularly vulnerable to marginalisation and abandonment. The work herein will form the first
  systematic synthesis of the evidence of impacts of farm land abandonment in mountain areas across the globe.
  Methods: This review will take the form of two interrelated systematic maps, cataloguing the existing evidence
  across a wide range of variables such as setting, methodology, scale, measured outcomes etc. Mapping will be
  undertaken both at abstract-level at a coarse scale and at full text-level at a finer scale. Literature databases,
  organisational web sites, and search engines will be used to collate all of the available literature regarding the
  impacts of agricultural land abandonment. All studies investigating farmland abandonment in mountainous regions
  with an appropriate comparator and measuring an appropriate outcome will be included. Outcomes will be coded
  in a partly iterative process but will include; natural hazards (fire-/flood risk, land/mud slides), soil (fertility, erosion),
  water (chemistry, eutrophication, sediment load, hydrology), ecosystem functioning (biodiversity, abundance,
  invasive species presence), socio-economics (e.g. health, wellbeing, employment). The systematic map outputs will
  be in the form of searchable databases of relevant and obtainable (full text only) literature, coded by subject,
  methodology and study design, and internal validity.
