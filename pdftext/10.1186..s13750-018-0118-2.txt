   Abstract
   Background: Antibiotic treatments are indispensable for human and animal health. However, the heavy usage of
   antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistance. Antibiotic residues, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes are
   introduced into the terrestrial and aquatic environments via application of human and animal wastes. The emergence
   and the spread of antibiotic resistance in environmental reservoirs (i.e., soil, water, wildlife) threatens the efficacy of
   all antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to determine what effective solutions exist to minimize the dissemi‑
   nation of antibiotic resistance in the environment. The aim of this article is to describe the protocol of a systematic
   review of the literature considering these solutions.
   Methods: The primary questions addressed by the systematic review protocol are: how antibiotic resistance in the
   environment is impacted by changes in practice concerning (i) the use of antibiotics, (ii) the management of wastes
   or (iii) the management of the natural compartment. Bibliographic searches will be made in eleven publication
   databases as well as in specialist databases. Grey literature will also be searched. Articles will be screened regarding
   the inclusion and exclusion criteria at title, abstract and full-text levels. Studies where a causal relationship between
   the intervention and the outcome is made will be retained. After critical appraisal, data from the selected articles will
   be extracted and saved in a database validated by the expert panel. Study quality will be assessed by critical appraisal.
   Data will be compiled into a qualitative synthesis. If data availability and quality allow it, a quantitative synthesis will
   be carried out.
