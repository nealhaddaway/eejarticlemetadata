  Abstract
  Background: Climate change and high rates of global carbon emissions have focussed attention on the need for
  high-quality monitoring systems to assess how much carbon is present in terrestrial systems and how these change
  over time. The choice of system to adopt should be guided by good science. There is a growing body of scientific
  and technical information on ground-based and remote sensing methods of carbon measurement. The adequacy
  and comparability of these different systems have not been fully evaluated.
  Methods: A systematic review will compare methods of assessing carbon stocks and carbon stock changes in key
  land use categories, including, forest land, cropland, grassland, and wetlands, in terrestrial carbon pools that can be
  accounted for under the Kyoto protocol (above- ground biomass, below-ground biomass, dead wood, litter and soil
  carbon). Assessing carbon in harvested wood products will not be considered in this review.
  Discussion: Developing effective mitigation strategies to reduce carbon emissions and equitable adaptation
  strategies to cope with increasing global temperatures will rely on robust scientific information that is free from
  biases imposed by national and commercial interests. A systematic review of the methods used for assessing
  carbon stocks and carbon stock changes will contribute to the transparent analysis of complex and often
  contradictory science.

their findings as most data drew from only four coun-
tries (Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and USA) and a
limited number of studies. They point to the need for a
more comprehensive analysis of some hypotheses gener-
ated in their study: soil carbon stocks decline after land
use changes from pasture to plantation (−10%), native
forest to plantation (−13%), native forest to crop (−42%),
and pasture to crop (−59%). Soil carbon stocks increase
after land use changes from native forest to pasture
(+8%), crop to pasture (+19%), crop to plantation
(+18%), and crop to secondary forest (+53%). Most land
use on peat soils requires drainage and is associated with
a continuous loss of soil carbon stock.
