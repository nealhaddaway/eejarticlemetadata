  Abstract
  Background: Establishing Protected Areas (PAs) is among the most common conservation interventions. Protecting
  areas from the threats posed by human activity will by definition inhibit some human actions. However, adverse
  impacts could be balanced by maintaining ecosystem services or introducing new livelihood options. Consequently
  there is an ongoing debate on whether the net impact of PAs on human well-being at local or regional scales is
  positive or negative. We report here on a systematic review of evidence for impacts on human well-being arising
  from the establishment and maintenance of terrestrial PAs.
  Methods: Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches were conducted for evidence of impacts of PAs post
  1992. After article title screening, the review was divided into two separate processes; a qualitative synthesis of
  explanations and meaning of impact and a review of quantitative evidence of impact. Abstracts and full texts were
  assessed using inclusion criteria and conceptual models of potential impacts. Relevant studies were critically
  appraised and data extracted and sorted according to type of impact reported. No quantitative synthesis was
  possible with the evidence available. Two narrative syntheses were produced and their outputs compared in
  a metasynthesis.
  Results: The qualitative evidence review mapped 306 articles and synthesised 34 that were scored as high quality.
  The quantitative evidence review critically appraised 79 studies and included 14 of low/medium susceptibility to
  bias. The meta-synthesis reveals that a range of factors can lead to reports of positive and negative impacts of PA
  establishment, and therefore might enable hypothesis generation regarding cause and effect relationships, but
  resulting hypotheses cannot be tested with the current available evidence.
  Conclusions: The evidence base provides a range of possible pathways of impact, both positive and negative, of
  PAs on human well-being but provides very little support for decision making on how to maximise positive
  impacts. The nature of the research reported to date forms a diverse and fragmented body of evidence unsuitable
  for the purpose of informing policy formation on how to achieve win-win outcomes for biodiversity and human
  well-being. To better assess the impacts of PAs on human well-being we make recommendations for improving
  research study design and reporting.
