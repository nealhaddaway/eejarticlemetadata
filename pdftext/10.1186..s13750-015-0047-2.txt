The comparative biological effects
of spatial management measures in protecting
marine biodiversity: a systematic review

   Abstract
   Background: The global decline of marine biodiversity and the perceived need to protect marine ecosystems from
   irreparable alterations to ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service provision have produced an extensive range
   of spatial management measures (SMMs). The design of SMMs is a complex process often involving the integration
   of both conservation objectives and socio-economic priorities and the resultant trade-offs are highly dependent on
   the management regime in place. Future marine management is likely to involve greater use of different forms of
   protected areas with differing levels of protection, particularly for sites where there are multiple competing demands.
   Consequently, evaluations of the characteristics that enable different forms of SMMs to successfully achieve their
   objectives are required to inform future conservation networks. The objective of this evidence-based analysis is to
   assess and compare the biological effects of different forms of SMMs with the aim of providing additional guidelines
   and insight into the design of future SMMs.
   Methods: SMMs will be grouped into four main categories according to the degree of management enforcement
   (marine reserve, marine protected area, partial permanent protection, partial temporal protection). To identify and
   collate evidence to address these questions a comprehensive systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature
   and grey literature will be undertaken. Articles will be examined for relevance using specified inclusion criteria and
   the included papers will be critically appraised. Studies that examine the effects on an outcome comparing at least
   one spatial management measure vs no protection (open access area) or between interventions will be considered.
   Subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be performed to explore variation in biological effects in relation to
   covariates (SMMs parameters, habitat and species functional and biological traits).

anthropogenic impacts and to increase the ecological
resilience of response to a changing climate has resulted
in an astonishing variety of spatial management measures
differing in size, location, level of protection (enforce-
ment), management approaches and objectives [6]. Spa-
tially based management approaches encompass a wide
range of tools reflecting a range of management aims,
from restriction measures and no-take zones to partial
protection measures in the context of multiple-use objec-
tives and ocean zoning. Moreover, the design of spatial
management measures has become increasingly complex
with both conservation goals and socio-economic con-
siderations at multiple levels being integrated in order
to limit “trade-offs” in different designs. The variety in
designs often reflects the different contexts (e.g. environ-
mental, social, economic and political scenarios) in which
conservation is being undertaken.
  In this complex context we propose a global scale evi-
dence-based analysis to compare and assess the effects of
spatial management measures on marine biodiversity and,
where possible, their ability to meet their conservation
objectives (although note that these are often broad and
may not be available for all SMMs considered). Addition-
ally, useful insights and guidelines to appropriately design
future spatial management measures might be provided.
