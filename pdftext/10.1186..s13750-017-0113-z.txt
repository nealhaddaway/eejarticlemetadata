  Abstract
  How to best assess potential health, environmental and other impacts of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and
  how to interpret the resulting evidence base have been long-standing controversial issues in the EU. As a response,
  transparency and inclusiveness became a major focus of regulatory science activities in the GMO impact area. Nev-
  ertheless, nearly three decades of controversies resulted in a heavily polarized policy environment, calling for further
  efforts. Against this backdrop the EU funded project GRACE explored the value of evidence synthesis approaches
  for GMO impact assessment and developed an evidence synthesis framework with a strong emphasis on openness,
  stakeholder engagement, transparency, and responsiveness to tackle regulatory science challenges. This framework
  was tested and implemented in the course of 14 systematic reviews or maps conducted on selected review questions
  spanning potential health, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts of GMOs. An inclusive development and pri-
  oritisation of review questions is of key importance in evidence synthesis as it helps to provide a better link between
  stakeholder demands and concerns and policy relevant outcomes. This paper, therefore, places a particular focus on
  the stakeholder involvement strategy developed and experiences gathered during this particular step in the course of
  the GRACE project. Based on this experience, possible lessons for future engagement exercises in highly controversial
  fields of regulatory science are discussed.

  All four review questions were revisited based on stakeholder comments
b
  The prioritization exercise initially produced 11 questions, of which 3 were kept unchanged, 2 were further modified, 6 were dropped and another one added
c
  27 review questions on micro level socio-economic impacts were combined into one broad systematic map; 4 review questions on macro level socio-economic
impacts were selected based on 14 candidate questions—two of the four questions were combined into one review question
d
  2 questions were dropped as separate questions but included in the scope of other review questions
