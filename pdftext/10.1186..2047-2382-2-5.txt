What is the evidence that invasive species are a
significant contributor to the decline or loss of
threatened species? A systematic review map

  Abstract
  Background: Invasive species have been reported as one of the leading causes of species extinction. However, the
  evidence to support or contest their effects on the decline and/or extinction of threatened species has been largely
  unavailable and few efforts have been made to collate such information. In order to develop national and
  international policies addressing the loss of threatened species, and to prioritise research and mitigation efforts, the
  evidence needs to be systematically reviewed and mapped to determine the importance of such effects.
  Methods/design: The searching of online publication databases, grey literature and other resources, such as
  recovery plans of endangered species, aims to gather existing evidence on whether invasive species are a
  significant contributor to the decline and/or extinction of threatened species. This study focuses on US species
  under threat. The methods used to carry out the systematic review will address the following two fundamental
  questions: (a) what proportion of threatened species have an invasive species as a significant contributor to their
  decline and (b) through what mechanisms do invasive species contribute towards the decline of native species?
  The pool of resources gathered will be analysed for relevance and quality using a pre-defined scoring system. A
  systematic map will be produced, summarising information from individual studies. Where possible, data will be
  extracted from included studies and synthesised using meta-analysis.
