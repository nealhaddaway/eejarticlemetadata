  Abstract
  Background: Issues of food security and nutrition have wide reaching implications for people and their environments,
  particularly in low and middle-income countries. One proposed solution is urban agriculture, which has been widely
  upheld as a solution to the food-crisis facing increasingly metropolitan populations. It is believed to provide the urban
  poor with food and a source of potential income, whilst improving the urban environment and reducing pressure on
  finite farmland. Although it faded from many development agendas in the 1990’s, urban agriculture has seen a
  resurgence since a peak in global food prices in the late 2000’s. There are, however, potential disadvantages to this
  increasing drive for urban agriculture including associated urban health risks and implications for the environment. The
  usage of waste-water, for example, may contaminate produced food and intensive irrigation might lead to the spread of
  malaria and water borne diseases, as well as threatening already limited water supplies. Soil erosion and the intensive use
  of fertilizers and pesticides might also present health risks to urban populations and damage the environment. Despite
  the potential benefits and harms of urban agriculture, the evidence-base is not well understood. Given the current policy
  drive to promote urban agriculture, there is an urgent need to understand its effects on urban populations and their
  environments.
  Methods/design: This review will seek out, select, appraise and synthesise evidence on the impacts of urban agriculture
  on food security and nutrition. We will employ systematic review methodology to ensure that our review of the evidence
  is comprehensive, transparent and replicable. In addition to searching electronic databases, we will examine websites and
  contact academics, practitioners and policy-makers for relevant research. All potentially relevant literature will be screened
  against pre-specified criteria and assessed for risk of bias using established critical appraisal tools. This is to ensure that we
  only include the evidence in which we have confidence. Depending on the nature of the available data, we will then
  synthesise the available evidence using statistical meta-analysis and/or narrative synthesis. Our findings will be
  disseminated in a variety of ways to ensure that the evidence is available for policy-makers and practitioners.
