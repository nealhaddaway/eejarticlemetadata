contamination of groundwater on human health in
developing countries effective? A systematic review

  Abstract
  Background: Within developing countries, groundwater provides an alternative drinking source to polluted surface
  water. However, the presence of arsenic in some groundwater sources has resulted in chronic worldwide
  poisoning. The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of field-based technologies for the removal of
  arsenic from groundwater in developing countries.
  Methods: A structured search strategy was conducted in a range of databases. Titles, abstracts and full texts were
  screened using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Included studies were quality appraised prior to data extraction. The
  primary outcome was the percentage of effluent water samples meeting WHO guidelines for arsenic concentrations
  (≤0.01 mg/L). Secondary outcomes included: (a) arsenic concentrations in effluent water samples meeting the
  national guideline limit (≤0.05 mg/L), (b) arsenic concentrations in human tissue, and (c) knowledge and attitudes
  related to the interventions.
  Results: Fifty-one reports, evaluating 50 different technologies, were included. Sixty-seven percent (n = 34) of
  studies were conducted in Bangladesh. Fifty of the included reports were appraised as ‘weak’, with one ‘strong’
  report of a randomised-controlled trial.
  In summary, the effectiveness of the oxidation and filtration interventions is poor, while the evidence for
  coagulation, co-precipitation and filtration, subterranean and membrane and electrolytic methods is mixed.
  Evidence regarding adsorption and zero valent iron interventions is more persuasive with most results suggesting
  good evidence of effectiveness (i.e. ≥95% of samples with arsenic concentrations ≤0.01 mg/L). In particular,
  activated alumina and sono/three-kolshi/gagri/pitcher filters have ≥95% of samples meeting national guidelines.
  Disappointingly, only one study reports excellent evidence of effectiveness: BRAC (2000) for activated alumina
  (i.e. ≥95% of samples with arsenic concentrations ≤0.01 mg/L).
  The success of each technology was highly dependent on context, especially their acceptability to users, a sense of
  ownership and expectations of women’s roles in society.
  Conclusions: Most studies were poorly conducted and reported. Consequently, although some technologies met
  national guidelines, the evidence-base for decision-making regarding arsenic mitigation technologies at
  household- and community-level is weak. To improve this situation, primary research needs to be commissioned
  with adequate sample sizes, testing the impact of key contextual factors, using valid tools for analysis, and meeting
  standards for completeness of reporting.

                                   (Amin, 2010).
                                   After three months, most of the filters were found to be dirty and without lids and the buckets for storing

                                   were only washed without changing them. The users of three filters had stopped operation of the filters after
                                   two to three months (Amin, 2010).
                                   Two households did not replace the filter bed materials. They reused the materials after washing them, rinsed
                                   with Ca(ClO)2 and dried them. For the remaining six households, the disposal of the spent filter materials was
                                   carried out in different ways. Two households threw the spent filters materials at the back of their houses on

                                   The visually observable removal of iron from the pumped water makes the effect of sand filters recognisable
                                   even to people who are not aware of the arsenic problem. Eighty-two percent of respondents with sand filters
                                   would decide again in favour of it. Of households without sand filters, 36% would decide in favour of it.

                                   Respondents reported changing the sand in the filters every three to four months. This is near the
