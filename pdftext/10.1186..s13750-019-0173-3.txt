   Abstract
   Background: The regular addition of plant-available nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, either as manu-
   factured fertilisers or animal manure, to agricultural soils is needed for global food security. Increased recycling of
   nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural–urban sustainability. Anaero-
   bic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and also capture its
   energetic value via biogas production. The liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients
   to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. Two such promising technologies that could increase nutri-
   ent recycling from e.g. wastewater and thereby contribute to environmental amelioration are struvite precipitation
   and ammonia stripping. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, a
   treatment process that provides both renewable energy and plant nutrients is achieved. This review will examine the
   effectiveness of ecotechnologies for the recovery and reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate
   with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment.
   Methods: We will search for both academic and grey literature published after 2013. English language searches will
   be performed in 4 bibliographic databases, and Google Scholar, while searches in 41 specialist websites will be per-
   formed in English, Finnish, Polish and Swedish. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and abstract
   and full text. Included eligible studies will be subject to a critical appraisal that will assess external and internal study
   validity. We will extract information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and meas-
   ured outcomes. Data synthesis will involve narrative synthesis of each included study of sufficient validity. Quantita-
   tive synthesis (i.e. meta-analysis) may be possible in cases where a sufficient number of studies report similar types of
   outcomes.
