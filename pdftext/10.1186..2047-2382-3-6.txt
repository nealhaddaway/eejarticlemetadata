   Abstract
   Background: Alternative livelihood projects are used by a variety of organisations as a tool for achieving
   conservation results. Yet these interventions, including their objectives, vary a great deal, and there is no single
   accepted definition of what constitutes an alternative livelihood project. In addition, very little is known about what
   impacts, if any, alternative livelihoods projects have had on biodiversity conservation, as well as what determines
   the success or failure of these interventions. Reflecting this concern, a resolution was passed at the IUCN World
   Conservation Congress in 2012 calling for a critical review of the benefits to biodiversity of alternative livelihood
   projects. This systematic review is intended to contribute to this resolution.
   Methods/Design: This protocol details the methodology for exploring the research question: Are alternative
   livelihood projects effective at reducing local threats to specified elements of biodiversity and/or improving or
   maintaining the conservation status of those elements? The aim of this proposed systematic review is to provide an
   overview for researchers, policy makers and practitioners of the current state of the evidence base. To undertake
   this, the systematic review will explore peer-reviewed research from the bibliographic databases SCOPUS, Web of
   Science, CAB Abstracts, AGRIS and AGRICOLA using search terms and Boolean search operators. The systematic
   review will also explore grey literature sources by conducting searches on Google, subject specific websites and
   institutional websites. Additionally, the review will use calls for papers and snowballing techniques to further
   identify literature. In order to identify relevant evidence, inclusion criteria will be used to screen the titles and
   abstracts of the captured literature. Data will be extracted from the final list of relevant documents by using a
   questionnaire established through literature review and a stakeholder workshop. The key output of this review will
   be a report on the state of the evidence, and, if the data permits, an estimate of the effectiveness of alternative
   livelihood interventions.
