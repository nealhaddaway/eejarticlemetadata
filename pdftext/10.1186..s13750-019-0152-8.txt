   Abstract
   Background: Mining activities, including prospecting, exploration, construction, operation, maintenance, expansion,
   abandonment, decommissioning and repurposing of a mine can impact social and environmental systems in a range
   of positive and negative, and direct and indirect ways. Mining can yield a range of benefits to societies, but it may
   also cause conflict, not least in relation to above-ground and sub-surface land use. Similarly, mining can alter environ-
   ments, but remediation and mitigation can restore systems. Boreal and Arctic regions are sensitive to impacts from
   development, both on social and environmental systems. Native ecosystems and aboriginal human communities are
   typically affected by multiple stressors, including climate change and pollution, for example.
   Methods: We will search a suite of bibliographic databases, online search engines and organisational websites for rel-
   evant research literature using a tested search strategy. We will also make a call for evidence to stakeholders that have
   been identified in the wider 3MK project (https​://osf.io/cvh3u​/). We will screen identified and retrieved articles at two
   distinct stages (title and abstract, and full text) according to a predetermined set of inclusion criteria, with consistency
   checks at each level to ensure criteria can be made operational. We will then extract detailed information relating to
   causal linkages between actions or impacts and measured outcomes, along with descriptive information about the
   articles and studies and enter data into an interactive systematic map database. We will visualise this database on an
   Evidence Atlas (an interactive, cartographic map) and identify knowledge gaps and clusters using Heat Maps (cross-
   tabulations of important variables, such as mineral type and studied impacts). We will identify good research practices
   that may support researchers in selecting the best study designs where these are clear in the evidence base.

impact assessments (EIAs and SIAs) that are conducted
prior to major activities such as resource extraction [24,
25]. Mitigation of negative environmental impacts in one
system (e.g. water or soil) can influence other systems
such as wellbeing of local communities and biodiver-
sity in a positive or negative manner [23]. A wide range
of technological engineering solutions have been imple-
mented to treat contaminated waters (e.g. constructed
wetlands [26], reactive barriers treating groundwater
[27], conventional wastewater treatment plants). Phy-
toremediation of contaminated land is also an area of
active research [28].
   Mitigation measures designed to alleviate the negative
impacts of mining on social and environmental systems
may not always be effective, particularly in the long-term
and across systems, e.g. a mitigation designed to affect an
environmental change may have knock on changes in a
social system. Indeed, the measures may have uninten-
tional adverse impacts on environments and societies. To
date, little research appears to have been conducted into
mitigation measure effectiveness, and we were unable to        Fig. 1 Map of mines in the Arctic region active as of 2011
