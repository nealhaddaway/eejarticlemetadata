What is the available evidence that artificial
light at night affects animal behaviour?

   Abstract
   Background: Artificial light at night (ALAN), has increased dramatically over the past two centuries and is linked to
   demonstrable shifts in a range of behaviours across diverse animal taxa. This systematic map will collate and synthe-
   sise the documented effects of ALAN on animal behaviour and fitness, identify gaps in the literature, inform future
   research and provide the basis for a decision-making tool for informing policy makers.
   Methods: This systematic map will summarise and examine all available evidence on the effects of ALAN on animal
   behaviour and ensuing fitness effects. All documented changes to behaviour in animals (excluding humans), will be
   included and both peer reviewed primary and grey literature will be searched. Searches will be conducted in aca-
   demic journal databases, online search engines, and specialist websites. Articles will be screened for inclusion in the
   systematic map at title, abstract and full-text levels and will then be critically appraised for study robustness and valid-
   ity. Data from studies included in the review will then be extracted and coded according to categories informed by
   consultation with Stakeholders. Data will be summarised, where possible, in a quantitative manner, accompanied with
   a descriptive overview. Future avenues for research and specific questions suitable for a systematic literature review
   will be formulated.
