  Abstract
  Background: Shallow nearshore marine ecosystems are changing at an increasing rate due to a range of human
  activities such as urbanisation and commercial development. As a result, an increasing number of structural modifica-
  tions occur in coastal nursery and spawning habitats of fish. Concomitant to this increase, there have been declines in
  many coastal fish populations and changes in the composition of fish communities. As requested by Swedish stake-
  holders, this review aimed to synthesise scientific evidence of the impact on fish recruitment of structural modifica-
  tions in temperate coastal areas.
  Methods: We searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature on such impacts in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish,
  German, Swedish and Spanish. Searches were performed in bibliographic databases, specialist websites, bibliogra-
  phies of review articles. We also contacted stakeholder to find relevant literature. Eligible studies included small- and
  large-scale field studies in marine systems and large lakes (> 10,000 km2) in temperate regions of the Northern and
  Southern Hemispheres. Included replicated comparisons of fish recruitment between altered and unaltered control
  areas, comparisons before and after an alteration, or both. Relevant outcomes (response variables) included measures
  of recruitment defined as abundance of juvenile fish in coastal habitats. All fish species were considered. Articles were
  screened for eligibility by title, abstract and full text. Eligible studies were critically appraised based on their external
  and internal validity. From each eligible study of sufficient validity, we extracted information on study design, meas-
  ured outcomes, exposure, type of comparator, effect modifiers and study findings. Study findings were synthesised
  narratively.
  Results: We searched for eligible studies in 15 databases, 24 specialist websites, Google Scholar, and bibliographies
  of 11 review articles. The review finally included 37 studies that were eligible and of sufficient validity to be considered
  for final synthesis. Most studies (23 of 37) were from the Northern Hemisphere. Studies varied in design, spatial resolu-
  tion, target fish species, and type of structural habitat change. This high level of variation did not allow for a quantita-
  tive synthesis and prevented us from drawing general conclusions on the impact of structures or structural modifi-
  cations on fish recruitment. In this review we provide a narrative synthesis of the evidence base and classify eligible
  studies into six categories (based on type of exposure and comparator). The categories are as follows: the impacts

  on fish recruitment of: (1) artificial structures in coastal areas, (2) structures designed as fish attractors, (3) large scale
  urban sprawl, (4) ‘novel’ habitats, (5) habitat loss, and (6) restoration.
  Conclusions: This review revealed a very limited evidence base for how structural modifications and marine urban
  sprawl can affect fish recruitment. Thus, there is a substantial mismatch between stakeholder needs and research
  evidence. Further, the impact and ecological performance of artificial structures depend both on context and species.
  Clearly, there is a need for more research on the subject, especially on long-term consequences at larger spatial scales.
