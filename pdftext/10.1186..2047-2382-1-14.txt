Will environmental flows increase the abundance
of native riparian vegetation on lowland rivers?
A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: The extraction of water and alteration of flow regimes by humans have profound negative effects on
  river ecosystems. Returning water as “environmental flows” is a primary method for restoration, but evidence linking
  flow restoration to ecological benefits is weak. In order to draw more informative conclusions about the effects of
  environmental flows on ecosystems, reviews of ecological responses to altered flow regime need to focus on
  relationships between causes (flow components) and effects (ecological responses). We will review the literature on
  the responses of native riparian vegetation to flow alterations on regulated rivers. This review should improve river
  restoration efforts by identifying which flow components can be targeted by environmental flows to improve
  vegetation condition and increase abundance at the individual, population, and community levels.
  Methods: We will conduct our review using the Eco Evidence framework, a novel, freely-available systematic review
  method and software that employs a standardised methodology to assess cause-effect hypotheses in the face of
  weak evidence. We will search published and grey literature for studies that present primary data on the responses
  of native riparian vegetation on lowland river banks to changes in flow regime. The review will assess evidence for
  seven distinct hypotheses that include different flow components (flood area, depth, duration, frequency,
  seasonality, and volume) and vegetation responses (condition, germination rates, reproduction, and survival). We
  will extract information from relevant studies on the trajectories of causes and effects, the type of study design, and
  the number of control and impact sampling units. This information will be used to weight studies, where studies
  with more sampling units or stronger study designs are given a higher weighting, as spurious results are less likely.
  The amount of weighted evidence supporting and refuting each hypothesis will determine which of four possible
  outcomes we will reach: “Support for hypothesis”, “Support for alternative hypothesis”, “Inconsistent evidence”, or
  “Insufficient evidence”. We will then collectively consider the conclusions for each hypothesis in order to answer
  our primary question, summarise the evidence, identify any gaps in knowledge, and provide recommendations for
  whether and how environmental flows could be used in the management of native riparian vegetation.

The evidence weight is the sum of the weight applied for the study design and the number of sampling units. See text for an explanation of weights.
"B" = before, "A" = After, "C" = control, "R" = reference, "I" = impact, "M" = multiple.
