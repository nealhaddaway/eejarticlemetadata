How effective is ‘greening’ of urban areas
in reducing human exposure to ground-level
ozone concentrations, UV exposure and the
‘urban heat island effect’? A protocol to update
a systematic review

   Abstract
   Background: The impact of climate change on public health may occur through a number of main pathways includ-
   ing increased temperature, ground-level ozone levels and ultra-violet radiation, which have a range of consequences
   for human health. One strategy for adaptation to the predicted effects of climate change on health that has been
   proposed, is to ‘green’ urban areas, essentially by increasing the abundance and cover of vegetation. This protocol is
   for an update of a systematic review which aimed to address the question: How effective is ‘greening’ of urban areas in
   reducing human exposure to ground-level ozone concentrations, UV exposure and the ‘urban heat island effect’?
   Methods: A sensitive search of multiple databases and relevant journals for relevant published articles will be
   conducted. A search for relevant unpublished articles will be undertaken through an internet search and of websites
   of relevant organisations. Inclusion criteria will be applied at title, abstract and full-text. Repeatability checks of this
   screening process will be undertaken. Articles included at full-text will be critically appraised using a standardised
   checklist. A repeatability check will be made of this process. Pre-defined data items will be extracted from included
   articles. If appropriate, quantitative synthesis will be undertaken through meta-analysis and/or a narrative synthesis
   will be undertaken.
