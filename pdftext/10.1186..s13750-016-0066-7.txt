Comparing groups versus individuals
in decision making: a systematic review protocol
Nibedita Mukherjee1* , Lynn V. Dicks1, Gorm E. Shackelford1, Bhaskar Vira2 and William J. Sutherland1
   Abstract
   Background: Biodiversity management requires effective decision making at various stages. However decision mak-
   ing in the real world is complex, driven by multiple factors and involves a range of stakeholders. Understanding the
   factors that influence decision making is crucial to addressing the conflicts that arise in conservation. Decisions can
   be made either by individuals or by groups. This precise context has been studied extensively for several decades by
   behavioural economists, social psychologists and intelligence analysts. The observations from these disciplines can
   offer useful insights for biodiversity conservation. A systematic review on group versus individual decision making is
   currently lacking. This systematic review would enable us to synthesize the key insights from these disciplines for a
   range of scenarios useful for conservation.
   Methods: The review will document studies that have investigated differences between group and individual deci-
   sion making. The focus will be on empirical studies; the comparators in this case are decisions made by individuals
   while the intervention is group decision making. Outcomes include level of bias in decision outcomes or group per-
   formance. The search terms will include various combinations of the words “group”, “individual” and “decision-making”.
   The searches will be conducted in major publication databases, google scholar and specialist databases. Articles will
   be screened at the title and abstract and full text level by two reviewers. After checking for internal validity, the articles
   will be synthesized into subsets of decision contexts in which decision making by groups and individuals have been
   compared. The review process, all extracted data, original studies identified in the systematic review process and
   inclusion and exclusion decisions will be freely available as Additional file 1 in the final review.
