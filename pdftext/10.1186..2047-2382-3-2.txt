on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks?

  Abstract
  Background: Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks significantly influence the atmospheric C concentration.
  Agricultural management practices that increase SOC stocks thus may have profound effects on climate mitigation.
  Additional benefits include higher soil fertility since increased SOC stocks improve the physical and biological
  properties of the soil. Intensification of agriculture and land-use change from grasslands to croplands are generally
  known to deplete SOC stocks. The depletion is exacerbated through agricultural practices with low return of organic
  material and various mechanisms, such as oxidation/mineralization, leaching and erosion. However, a systematic
  review comparing the efficacy of different agricultural management practices to increase SOC stocks has not yet
  been produced. Since there are diverging views on this matter, a systematic review would be timely for framing
  policies not only nationally in Sweden, but also internationally, for promoting long-term sustainable management
  of soils and mitigating climate change.
  Methods: The systematic review will examine how changes in SOC are affected by a range of soil-management
  practices relating to tillage management, addition of crop residues, manure or other organic “wastes”, and different
  crop rotation schemes. Within the warm temperate and the snow climate zones, agricultural management systems
  in which wheat, barley, rye, oats, silage maize or oilseed rape can grow in the crop rotation will be selected. The
  review will exclusively focus on studies conducted over at least 10 years. Searches will be made in 15 publication
  databases as well as in specialist databases. Articles found will be screened using inclusion/exclusion criteria at title,
  abstract and full-text levels, and screening consistency will be evaluated using Kappa tests. Data from articles
  that remain after critical appraisal will be extracted using a predefined spreadsheet. Subgroup analyses will be
  undertaken to elucidate statistical relationships that are specific to particular type of management interventions.
  Meta-regression within subgroups will be performed as well as sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of
  removing groups of studies with low or unclear quality.

whereas C flux from soil to the ocean is 0.6 Pg C year-1.
   Even though organic C in many agricultural soils is be-
ing depleted through various mechanisms (oxidation/
mineralization, leaching and erosion), there are measures
other than land-use changes that potentially can slow
down or reverse this trend. Such measures include: i) di-
verse crop rotations including, for example, leys and
cover crops, ii) organic amendments such as manure or
crop residues, and iii) tillage modifications such as mini-
mum or no tillage.
Previous studies
The literature on carbon sequestration in agricultural soils
is extensive. However, SOC responds slowly to changes in
agricultural management [16]. Most SOC changes require
many years to be detectable by present analytical methods
[17], and therefore long-term experiments are required.
Nevertheless, a substantial number of studies have been
performed and few reviews have been published recently
[6,13,15,18,19].

analysis of data of 29 publications (from Spain) that
