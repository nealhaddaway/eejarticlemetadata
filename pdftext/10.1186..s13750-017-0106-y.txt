   Abstract
   Important policy questions tend to span a range of academic disciplines, and the relevant research is often carried
   out in a variety of social, economic and geographic contexts. In efforts to synthesise research to help inform decisions
   arising from the policy questions, systematic reviews need conceptual frameworks and ways of thinking that combine
   knowledge drawn from different academic traditions and contexts; in other words, transdisciplinary research. This
   paper considers how transdisciplinary working can be achieved with: conceptual frameworks that span traditional
   academic boundaries; methods for shaping review questions and conceptual frameworks; and methods for interpret‑
   ing the relevance of findings to different contexts. It also discusses the practical challenges and ultimate benefits of
   transdisciplinary working for systematic reviews.
