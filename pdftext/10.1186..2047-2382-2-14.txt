Does the effectiveness of forest protected areas
differ conditionally on their type of governance?
Biljana Macura1,2*, Laura Secco1 and Andrew S Pullin2
  Abstract
  Background: In context of protected areas (PAs), governance can be defined as a set of processes, procedures,
  resources, institutions and actors that determine how decisions are made and implemented. Current governance
  modes of forest PAs are multilevel and complex, with a variety of actors, different levels of power sharing, various
  formal and informal rules and vested interests. However, there is no systematic information on how different local
  governance modes and day-to-day decision-making processes within forest PAs may cause a change in PA
  effectiveness in terms of producing desired conservation outcomes. In this review we aim to assess relative
  effectiveness of forest PAs worldwide with respect to different governance modes and linking them to the multiple
  outcomes in order to discern the effective governance strategies for biodiversity and forest conservation. We will
  evaluate effectiveness of forest protected areas by multiple outcome measures: 1) attitudes of local stakeholders
  towards forest protected area governance, 2) conservation-related behaviour of local stakeholders, 3) ecological
  parameters such as forest cover, biodiversity level, density, overall forest condition and/or health as well as
  4) existence of local spillover effects defined as social, institutional and ecological effects in surrounding
  social-ecological systems.
  Methods: To gather empirical evidence on the effectiveness and outcomes of different governance arrangements of
  forest protected areas, we will search electronic databases, organizational websites, use web search engines and
  perform a bibliographic search. Articles will be filtered by title, abstract and full text. To facilitate understanding of
  predictors and conditions for effective PAs, both qualitative and quantitative data from the relevant studies will be
  extracted and integrated. Multivariate statistical analyses will be performed to give insights into association between
  different governance modes, their characteristics and PA effectiveness. Finally, the review will report on data gaps and
  potential for future empirical research.
