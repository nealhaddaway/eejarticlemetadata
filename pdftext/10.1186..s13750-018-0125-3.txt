  Abstract
  Background: Livestock grazing and ‘overabundance’ of large wild herbivores in forested areas have long been
  perceived as conflicting with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however, certain kinds of her-
  bivory can help to maintain habitat values in forest ecosystems. Management of mammalian herbivory in protected
  forests can, therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. The primary aim of this systematic review was to
  examine how forest vegetation and invertebrates are affected by manipulation of the grazing/browsing pressure by
  livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate purpose was to investigate whether such manipulation is useful for conserv-
  ing or restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides.
  Methods: We considered studies of manipulated ungulate herbivory in forests anywhere within the boreal and tem-
  perate zones, not only in protected areas but also in production forest. Non-intervention or alternative levels of inter-
  vention were used as comparators. Relevant outcomes included abundance, diversity and composition of plants and
  invertebrates, tree regeneration, and performance of focal/target species. Studies were mainly selected from a recent
  systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity effects of forest management relevant to protected areas. Additional
  studies were identified through updated searches online and in bibliographies of existing reviews. Relevant studies
  were critically appraised, and studies with low or unclear validity were excluded from the review. Quantitative out-
  comes were extracted from 103 articles, and summary effect sizes were derived by meta-analysis.
  Results: Most of the 144 studies included in the review had been conducted in North America, Europe or Australia/
  New Zealand. The intervention most commonly studied was experimental exclusion (or enclosure) of wild and/or
  domestic ungulates by fencing. Other studies examined culling of wild ungulates or compared forests long grazed
  by livestock to ungrazed forests. Effects on vegetation and invertebrates were reported in 135 and 23 of the stud-
  ies, respectively. We found negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of understorey vegetation as a whole,
  woody understorey and bryophytes, and also in the species richness of woody understorey vegetation, whereas the
  richness of forbs and bryophytes responded positively. Several effects depended on ungulate origins: Understorey
  abundance responded negatively to livestock and to ungulates introduced into the wild, but not to native ones. In
  contrast, understorey species richness responded positively to livestock but not to wild ungulates. The duration and
  intensity of herbivory had few significant effects on vegetation—exceptions included woody understorey abundance

  negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of lepidopterans and spiders, but no significant effects on species
  richness.
  Conclusions: Our review revealed a large body of high-validity experimental studies on impacts of ungulate
  herbivory in forests. This evidence confirmed that manipulation of such herbivory is often highly influential on tree
  regeneration and on the abundance, diversity and composition of understorey vegetation. Nevertheless, we also
  identified important knowledge gaps—we found few studies of boreal areas, long-term herbivory effects, impacts on
  bryophytes, lichens and invertebrates, and effects of manipulation less radical than total exclusion of ungulates.

The table is based on study averages (presented as ranges and medians) of grazing/browsing pressure in areas exposed to high herbivory (e.g. unfenced control plots
in fencing studies). Reported herbivore densities have been converted by us to metabolic biomass (see Additional file 6), and livestock densities have been adjusted
for length of grazing season (see "Methods"). Note that quantitative data on grazing pressure were available for only three of the 17 studies of sustained/abandoned/
resumed grazing by livestock (or reindeer) included in the review
