Does post‑disturbance salvage logging
affect the provision of ecosystem services? A
systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Forest fires, insect outbreaks, and windstorms are common forest disturbances that are expected to
  increase in importance in coming decades. Post-disturbance management often involves salvage logging, i.e. the fell-
  ing and removal of the affected trees. However, harvesting these biological legacies may represent a second distur-
  bance whose effects on ecosystem processes add on those of the initial disturbance. Many of the potentially affected
  processes, such as soil erosion and stream water quality, represent regulating and supporting ecosystem services
  important for human society. In the last 15 years, much empirical evidence has been gathered on the ecological con-
  sequences of this management practice, and it has now become necessary to synthesise this evidence in meaningful
  ways for managers and decision-makers.
  Methods: With this systematic review we aim to synthesise the literature on the effects of salvage logging on eco-
  system services and determine the effects of major effect modifiers such as disturbance type and intensity, the timing
  and method of logging, and the type of forest. We will conduct searches of the primary scientific literature, which will
  be selected and categorised according to its relevance to the topic and its quality. Each relevant article will be read
  in full to obtain the necessary data for meta-analysis and to identify its main conclusions. Mixed-effects models will
  be performed to assess the effects of the identified effect modifiers on the effect sizes of the salvage intervention on
  ecosystem services and to account for random effects arising from studies being performed in the same area. Sensi-
  tivity analyses will test the potential effects of study quality, and publication bias will be assessed with the trim and fill
  method. We will present the results as a narrative review and a meta-analysis.
