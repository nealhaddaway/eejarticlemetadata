Can interventions that aim to decrease
Lyme disease hazard at non‑domestic sites
be effective without negatively affecting
ecosystem health? A systematic review protocol
Jo Middleton1,2* , Ian Cooper1 and Anja S. Rott1
  Abstract
  Background: Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported, broadly distributed vector-borne disease of the
  northern temperate zone. It is transmitted by ticks and, if untreated, can cause skin, cardiac, nervous system and mus-
  culoskeletal disease. The distribution and incidence of LD is increasing across much of North America and Western
  Europe. Interventions to decrease exposure to LD hazard by encouraging behavioural change have low acceptance
  in high risk groups, and a safe, effective human LD vaccine is not presently available. As a result, habitat level interven-
  tions to decrease LD hazard itself (i.e. levels of infected ticks) have been proposed. However, some interventions may
  potentially negatively affect ecosystem health, and consequentially be neither desirable, nor politically feasible. This
  systematic review will catalogue interventions that aim to reduce LD hazard at non-domestic sites, and examine the
  evidence supporting those which are unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health.
  Methods: The review will be carried out in two steps. First, a screening and cataloguing stage will be conducted to
  identify and characterise interventions to decrease LD hazard at non-domestic sites. Secondly, the subset of inter-
  ventions identified during cataloguing as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health will be investigated. In the
  screening and cataloguing step literature will be collected through database searching using pre-chosen search
  strings, hand-searching key journals and reviewing the websites of public health bodies. Further references will be
  identified by contacting stakeholders and researchers. Article screening and assessment of the likely effects of inter-
  ventions on ecosystem health will be carried out independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer will be consulted
  if disagreements arise. The cataloguing step results will be presented in tables. Study quality will then be assessed
  independently by two reviewers, using adapted versions of established tools developed in healthcare research. These
  results will be presented in a narrative synthesis alongside tables. Though a full meta-analysis is not expected to be
  possible, if sub-groups of studies are sufficiently similar to compare, a partial meta-analysis will be carried out.
