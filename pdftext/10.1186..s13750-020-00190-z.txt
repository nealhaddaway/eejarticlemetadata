   Abstract
   Background: There is growing evidence of the potential negative consequences of altered flow regimes, in terms
   of magnitude, frequency, timing, duration or season pattern, on fluvial ecosystems and the fisheries they support.
   The scientific and policy communities have acknowledged the need for a better understanding of the effects of flow
   alteration on fish productivity. We conducted a systematic map to provide an overview of the existing literature base
   on the effects of flow-regime changes on direct outcomes of freshwater or estuarine fish productivity in temperate
   regions to inform stakeholders and policy makers.
   Methods: To identify relevant articles for inclusion in this systematic map, we searched six bibliographic databases,
   29 organizational websites, one search engine, and 297 reviews, and solicited grey literature through relevant sources.
   We screened articles at title and abstract, then by full-text using predefined inclusion criteria. Included studies were
   coded for key variables of interest, along with a very basic critical appraisal for internal validity (i.e., susceptibility to
   bias). The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence, knowledge gaps and subtopics with sufficient cover-
   age for full systematic reviewing are reported in a narrative synthesis. The distribution and frequency of examined
   effects of flow-regime changes on fish productivity outcomes are presented in visual heatmaps.
   Review findings: A total of 1368 studies from 1199 articles were included in the systematic map database and used
   to identify a number of interesting themes in the evidence base: (1) large evidence bases were found in temperate
   regions of United States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia; (2) most studies either used a temporal or spatial
   trend design i.e., lacking a ‘true’ before intervention time period, or no intervention control sites; (3) the most studied
   causes of altered flow regime were natural (e.g., floods, droughts, climate change), hydroelectric facilities (hydro),
   and dams with no hydro; and (4) there were clear clusters of studies evaluating effects of changes in magnitude and
   surrogate measures (e.g., velocity, water depth) on fish productivity outcomes, in particular abundance and diversity
   metrics. A number of potential knowledge gaps were identified: including geographic (Northern Africa, and possibly
   parts of Asia), causes of altered flow regime (restoration, land-use change, and water abstraction/extraction/diver-
   sion), interventions (flow duration, frequency, rate of change, or timing), outcomes (population viability) and specific
   intervention/cause/outcome groups (e.g., changes in flow magnitude due to hydro or natural causes and fish survival,

  performance, and reproduction). A few aspects in methodology were also identified across studies, primarily a lack of
  true comparators (e.g., temporal or spatial trend designs).
  Conclusions: This map suggests subtopics warranting future evidence synthesis include, examinations into how
  changes in flow magnitude affects: (1) fish abundance for dams with no hydro causes; (2) fish abundance, diversity/
  richness, migration, and growth for hydro causes; and (3) fish abundance, diversity/richness, growth, community
  structure, recruitment, and migrating fish abundance for natural causes. More comprehensive evidence is needed
  to understand how: (1) fish productivity metrics are affected by changes in flow regime due to restoration, land-use
  change, and water withdrawal/diversion activities; (2) how fish productivity is affected by changes to components of
  flow regime other than magnitude (e.g., flow duration, frequency); and (3) changes in flow magnitude due to hydro
  or natural causes affect fish survival, performance, and reproduction; and (4) changes in flow regime (all causes, all
  interventions) affect population viability.

                    are three times the median daily flow per year, or the number of low flows where flow is below the 25th percentile per season), or as
                    the probability of occurrence of a flow (e.g., the probability of a 100-year flood)
Duration          Period of time associated with a specific flow condition. Duration could be defined relative to a particular flow event (e.g., a floodplain
                    may be inundated for a specific number of days by a 10-year flood), or as a composite expressed over a specified time period (e.g.,
                    the number of days in a year when flow exceeds some value). Antecedent flow, defined as the measure of time since a specific flow
                    level, was also included in the context of the number of dry days (form of duration of low flow)
Timing            Timing, seasonality, or predictability of flows of defined magnitude (referring to the regularity with which they occur)
Rate of change Rate of change, refers to how quickly flow changes from one magnitude to another
Surrogate         Surrogate of flow alteration e.g., water depth, flow stage (water level above an arbitrary point), water velocity, water area
Unspecified       An unspecified component of flow i.e., the study does not specify a flow component. For example, (1) the study compares an
                    unregulated stream (or section of a stream) to a regulated stream (i.e., regulated via a hydro dam) but does not include an actual
                    component of flow as outlined above); or (2) reports unspecified multiple components affecting flow (i.e., do not report effects of
                    components separately to isolate individual effects of components)
