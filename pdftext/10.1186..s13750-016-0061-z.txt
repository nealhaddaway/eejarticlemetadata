systems? A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Shallow nearshore marine ecosystems are changing at an increasing rate due to a range of human
  activities such as urbanisation and commercial development. The growing numbers of constructions and other
  physical and structural alterations of the shoreline often take place in nursery and spawning habitats of many fish and
  other aquatic species. Several coastal fish populations have seen marked declines in abundance and diversity during
  the past two decades. A systematic review on the topic would clarify if anthropogenic physical and structural changes
  of near-shore areas have effects on fish recruitment and which these effects are.
  Methods: The review will examine how various physical and structural anthropogenic changes of nearshore fish
  habitats affect fish recruitment. Relevant studies include small- and large-scale field studies in marine and brackish
  systems or large lakes in temperate regions of the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Relevant studies may be
  based on comparisons between undisturbed and disturbed areas, before and after disturbance, or both. Relevant out-
  comes include measures of recruitment defined as abundance of juveniles of nearshore fish communities. Searches
  will be made for peer-reviewed and grey literature in English, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, German, Swedish and Spanish.
  All fish species and species groups will be considered in this review. Included relevant studies will be subject to a
  critical appraisal that will assess study validity. From relevant included studies, we will extract information on study
  characteristics, measured outcomes, exposure, comparators, effect modifiers and critical appraisal. Data synthesis will
  contain narrative and summary findings of each included study of sufficient quality. Meta-analysis may be possible in
  cases where studies report similar types of outcomes.
