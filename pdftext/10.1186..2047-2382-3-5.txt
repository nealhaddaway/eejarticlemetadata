Evaluating effects of land management on
greenhouse gas fluxes and carbon balances in
boreo-temperate lowland peatland systems

  Abstract
  Background: Peatlands cover 2 to 5 percent of the global land area, while storing between 30 and 50 percent of
  all global soil carbon (C). Peatlands constitute a substantial sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) via
  photosynthesis and organic matter accumulation, but also release methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and CO2
  through respiration, all of which are powerful greenhouse gases (GHGs). Lowland peats in boreo-temperate regions
  may store substantial amounts of C and are subject to disproportionately high land-use pressure. Whilst evidence
  on the impacts of different land management practices on C cycling and GHG fluxes in lowland peats does exist,
  these data have yet to be synthesised. Here we report on the results of a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence
  (CEE) systematic review of this evidence.
  Methods: Evidence was collated through searches of literature databases, search engines, and organisational
  websites using tested search strings. Screening was performed on titles, abstracts and full texts using established
  inclusion criteria for population, intervention/exposure, comparator, and outcome key elements. Remaining
  relevant full texts were critically appraised and data extracted according to pre-defined strategies. Meta-analysis
  was performed where sufficient data were reported.
  Results: Over 26,000 articles were identified from searches, and screening of obtainable full texts resulted in the
  inclusion of 93 relevant articles (110 independent studies). Critical appraisal excluded 39 studies, leaving 71 to
  proceed to synthesis. Results indicate that drainage increases N2O emission and the ecosystem respiration of CO2,
  but decreases CH4 emission. Secondly, naturally drier peats release more N2O than wetter soils. Finally, restoration
  increases CH4 release. Insufficient studies reported C cycling, preventing quantitative synthesis. No significant
  effect was identified in meta-analyses of the impact of drainage and restoration on DOC concentration.
  Conclusions: Consistent patterns in C concentration and GHG release across the evidence-base may exist for
  certain land management practices: drainage increases N2O production and CO2 from respiration; drier peats
  release more N2O than wetter counterparts; and restoration increases CH4 emission. We identify several problems
  with the evidence-base; experimental design is often inconsistent between intervention and control samples,
  pseudoreplication is common, and variability measures are often unreported.
