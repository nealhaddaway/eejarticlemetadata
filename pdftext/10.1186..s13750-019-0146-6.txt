Evidence of the environmental impact
of noise pollution on biodiversity: a systematic
map protocol

  Abstract
  Background: For decades, biodiversity has suffered massive losses worldwide. Urbanization is one of the major driv-
  ers of extinction because it leads to the physical fragmentation and loss of natural habitats and it is associated with
  related effects, e.g. pollution and in particular noise pollution given that many man-made sounds are generated in cit-
  ies (e.g. industrial and traffic noise, etc.). However, all human activities generate sounds, even far from any human hab-
  itation (e.g. motor boats on lakes, aircraft in the air, etc.). Ecological research now deals increasingly with the effects
  of noise pollution on biodiversity. Many studies have shown the impacts of anthropogenic noise and concluded that
  it is potentially a threat to life on Earth. The present work describes a protocol to systematically map evidence of the
  environmental impact of noise pollution on biodiversity. The resulting map will inform on the species most studied
  and on the demonstrated impacts. This will be useful for further primary research by identifying knowledge gaps and
  in view of further analysis, such as systematic reviews.
  Methods: Searches will include peer-reviewed and grey literature published in English and French. Two online
  databases will be searched using English terms and search consistency will be assessed with a test list. No geographi-
  cal restrictions will be applied. The subject population will include all species. Exposures will include all types of
  man-made sounds (industrial, traffic, etc.) in all types of environments (or media) (terrestrial, aerial, aquatic), includ-
  ing all contexts and sound origins (spontaneous or recorded sounds, in situ or laboratory studies, etc.). All relevant
  outcomes will be considered (space use, reproduction, communication, abundance, etc.). An open-access database
  will be produced with all relevant studies selected during the three screening stages. For each study, the database will
  contain metadata on key variables of interest (species, types of sound, outcomes, etc.). This database will be available
  in conjunction with a map report describing the mapping process and the evidence base with summary figures and
  tables of the study characteristics.
