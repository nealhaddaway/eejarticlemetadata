   Abstract
   Background: Invasive alien plant species often have negative environmental and social impacts, such as loss of
   biodiversity and alteration of ecosystem services. As a result, managing the introduction, establishment, and abun-
   dance of invasive species is a major priority. To do this effectively, we need evidence on the effect of management
   interventions (such as using herbicide or cutting to control invasive plants). This evidence should not only include the
   effects of these management interventions on invasive alien species, but also on native species and other non-target
   outcomes such as ecosystem services. Such evidence would allow for comparison of the trade-offs between differ-
   ent management interventions. In the planned review we aim to assess how management interventions to control
   nine priority invasive alien plants species in England and Wales affect environmental outcomes. These species are:
   Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) Nuttall’s waterweed (Elodea nuttallii), Chilean rhubarb (Gunnera tinctoria), Giant
   hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), Floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens
   glandulifera), Curly waterweed (Lagarosiphon major), American skunk cabbage (Lysichiton americanus), Parrot’s feather
   (Myriophyllum aquaticum).
   Methods: Searches will be in English and use bibliographic databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Open
   Access Theses and Dissertations, and Conservation Evidence) and internet searches (Google Scholar), as well as specialist
   databases. Our methodology will only use the names of each species (scientific names and common names, includ-
   ing synonyms) as our search string (we will not use qualifiers, such as “AND invasive”). This will give low specificity but
   will increase the likelihood of capturing all relevant information. We will use predefined criteria for study inclusion
   and data extraction. We will screen publications in two stages: (1) using titles and abstracts and (2) using full texts.
   Consistency of inclusion will be checked by two people screening a random sample of 10% of titles and abstracts.
   This dual-screening will be subject to kappa analysis and any disagreements resolved through discussion. We will use
   critical appraisal to assess study validity by identifying studies that are potentially prone to bias.
