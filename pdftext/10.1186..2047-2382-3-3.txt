Which components or attributes of biodiversity
influence which dimensions of poverty?
Dilys Roe1*, Max Fancourt2, Chris Sandbrook2, Mxolisi Sibanda1, Alessandra Giuliani1 and Andrew Gordon-Maclean1
   Abstract
   Background: There is an explicit assumption in international policy statements that biodiversity can help in efforts to
   tackle global poverty. This systematic map was stimulated by an interest in better understanding the evidence behind
   this assumption by disaggregating the terms and asking - as our review question - which components or attributes of
   biodiversity influence which dimensions of poverty?
   Methods: We employed a search strategy that covered peer-reviewed and grey literature. Relevant studies included
   in the map were those that described an interaction by poor people with biodiversity in non-OECD countries and
   documented some kind of contribution (positive or negative) to different aspects of their well-being.
   Results: A total of 387 studies were included in the final systematic map. Of these 248 met our additional criteria that
   studies should include a measure of the contribution to poverty alleviation. The studies were widely distributed
   geographically. Ecological distribution was less well spread, however, with the largest number of studies focussed on
   forests. We found studies addressing 12 different dimensions of poverty/well-being – although the most commonly
   studied was income. Similarly we found studies addressing all levels of biodiversity from genes to ecosystems. The
   largest number of studies was focussed on groups of resources – particularly non-timber forest products. In most cases,
   abundance was the attribute that made biodiversity important for poverty alleviation/well-being, while diversity was
   the least frequently noted attribute.
   Conclusions: The map highlights a number of apparent gaps in the evidence base. Very few studies documented any
   causal link between use of biodiversity and an impact on poverty. In the majority of the studies biodiversity was framed
   in terms of its value as a resource – in the form of specific goods that can be used to generate tangible benefits such as
   cash, food fuel. Very few studies explored the underpinning role of biodiversity in ecosystem service delivery for
   poverty alleviation, and fewer investigated the benefits of diversity as a form of insurance or adaptive capacity. This is
   where we suggest research should be prioritised.
