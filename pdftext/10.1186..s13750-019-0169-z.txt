   Abstract
   Background: Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are abundant predatory species in many agroecosystems,
   are valued for their biological pest control functions, and have been recommended as test species for studies sup‑
   porting the assessment of non-target effects of insect-resistant Bt crops. Although insecticidal Bt proteins are known
   to be highly specific against target pests, some recent laboratory studies reported putative toxic effects of Bt proteins
   on ladybird species. While such studies have been criticised because of methodological shortcomings or inconsisten‑
   cies, they cast doubt on the insecticidal spectrum of activity of some Bt proteins. Performing a systematic review that
   synthesises all existing evidence on this controversial topic may help to resolve the remaining scientific uncertainties.
   The review question to be addressed by the systematic review is the following: Are ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coc-
   cinellidae) affected by Bt proteins expressed in genetically modified insect-resistant crops? The systematic review will focus
   on studies performed under controlled environmental conditions.
   Methods: An extensive literature search will be conducted to identify the articles relevant to the review question. A
   wide range of electronic bibliographic databases, the internet search engine Google Scholar, and websites of special‑
   ized organizations will be searched. Citation searching, reference list-checking and searching of key journals will also
   be performed. The relevance of the identified articles will be assessed against a set of pre-defined eligibility criteria,
   following a two-step approach. In the first step, title and abstract (or summary) will be screened, whilst in the second
   step the full text of all remaining articles will be assessed by two members of the review team. All relevant studies
   will be subjected to an appraisal of external (generalisability) and internal (risk of bias) validity. Data from the selected
   studies will be extracted and synthesised in a narrative report. If a sufficient number of datasets generated with com‑
   parable experimental setup is available, statistical meta-analyses will be conducted on a range of comparisons and
   including sensitivity analyses.

Background
Genetically modified (GM) crops have been cultivated
around the world since 1996. In 2017, the area devoted
to GM crops reached 189.8 million ha [1]. More than half
of this production involved crops that are engineered
to express one or more insecticidal proteins (Cry or Vip
proteins) from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)
for controlling lepidopteran and/or coleopteran pests.
Before their commercial release, GM crops undergo an
environmental risk assessment (ERA) to ensure that they
do not cause unacceptable detrimental effects to the
environment. One area of concern addressed in this risk
assessment is the potential adverse impact on non-target
arthropods (NTAs) and the ecosystem services they pro-
vide, including biological pest control by predators and
parasitoids [2].
   Ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are
important NTAs: they are abundant predatory species
in many agroecosystems [3, 4], are valued for their bio-
logical pest control functions [5] and have been recom-       Fig. 1 Interactions of Bt proteins produced by genetically modified

and therefore they can be exposed to Bt proteins under

  Outcome                               Studies report lethal (mortality or survival) and/or sub-lethal endpoints (e.g. growth, development, reproduc‑
