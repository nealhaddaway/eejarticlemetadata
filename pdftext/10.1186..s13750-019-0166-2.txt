Mapping the predicted and potential
impacts of metal mining and its mitigation
measures in Arctic and boreal regions using
environmental and social impact assessments:
a systematic map protocol

   Abstract
   Background: Since the 1960s, environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and recently, social impact assessments
   (SIAs), have been conducted during the planning stages of large development projects to identify potential adverse
   effects and propose mitigation measures to ameliorate these impacts. EIAs and SIAs should outline all possible posi-
   tive and negative effects of a proposed action or development on ecological and social systems, respectively, includ-
   ing biodiversity, flora and fauna, abiotic components (such as air quality), human health, security and wellbeing. The
   work outlined herein aims to generate a list of all possible direct and indirect effects of metal mining (including gold,
   iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver, molybdenum and lead) along with the impacts of mitigation measures proposed, that
   are mentioned in EIAs and SIAs in Arctic and boreal regions of the following countries/regions: Canada, Alaska (USA),
   Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.
   Methods: We will conduct searches for environmental and social impact assessments in Swedish and English, and
   until theoretical saturation is reached (i.e. no new action-impact pathways are identified). We will perform searches of
   specialist websites (e.g. public repositories of environmental and social impact assessments) and Google Scholar. We
   will also contact relevant stakeholders (that have been identified in the wider 3MK project https​://osf.io/cvh3u​/)
   and make a call for additional information. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and full text.
   Meta-data will be extracted from eligible studies including type of mining activity, location of mine, type of impacts,
   and planned mitigation measures. Findings will be presented narratively, in a searchable relational database and in
   an evidence altas (a cartographic map). We will produce a framework of different mining impacts and related mitiga-
   tion measures from practitioners’ knowledge reflected in EIAs and SIAs. This framework will further form the basis of a
   multiple knowledge base on mining impacts and mitigation measures generated from different knowledges includ-
   ing scientific, Indigenous, and practitioners’ knowledge.
