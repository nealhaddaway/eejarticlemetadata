Does production of oil palm, soybean, or jatropha
change biodiversity and ecosystem functions in
tropical forests
Sini Savilaakso1*, Yves Laumonier1,2, Manuel R Guariguata1 and Robert Nasi1
  Abstract
  Background: Biofuels, or fuels derived from transformation of biological matter, are hailed by some as a promising
  source of renewable energy potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A widespread adoption of biofuels will
  however present its own set of challenges and consequences. Direct or indirect land use change due to expansion
  of feedstock cultivation can cause deforestation and forest degradation leading to biodiversity losses and other
  environmental concerns like soil degradation and erosion, water pollution and scarcity, and the risk of crop species
  invading natural ecosystems.
  Although biofuel production is currently not the main use of palm oil and soybean and hence, has so far
  contributed only little to the land-use change patterns, it has been predicted to grow. Therefore, it is important to
  know the potential consequences of the expansion of biofuel cultivation may have for biodiversity in order to
  provide policy guidance.
  Methods/design: In this review, we will assess the current state of knowledge of the impact of three first
  generation biofuel crops - oil palm, soybean, and jatropha - on the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of the
  tropical forests. We will look at the additional comparison of impacts from industrial versus smallholder plantations,
  and will compare the mitigation potential of different standards related to biofuel production. We will consider
  both qualitative and quantitative primary studies as well as descriptive reports that compare land conversion for
  target crop production with other land uses or land cover types. Both before/after and site comparison studies will
  be included, and biodiversity indicators to be assessed are species richness, abundance, and plant and animal
  community composition. If there is enough data, quantitative meta-analysis will be performed. Otherwise results
  will be summarized narratively.
