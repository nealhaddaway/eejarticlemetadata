in Europe: a systematic map

   Abstract
   Background: Alien species are frequently considered a serious environmental threat but negative impacts on
   human health through injury, allergy, or as vectors of disease sometimes have the most dire consequences for human
   livelihoods. Climate change and the increasing magnitude and frequency of introductions of species across geo-
   graphic barriers as a result of international trade are likely to change their establishment, spread, abundance, physiol-
   ogy or phenology, potentially also altering their human health impacts. Yet despite receiving increasing attention
   in the scientific literature, there have been few attempts to quantify recent changes in human health impacts. Here
   we report the findings from a systematic map of the literature identifying evidence of any change in the occurrence,
   frequency or severity of impacts of alien species on human health in Europe over the last 25 years.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic search of the ecological and medical literature using English language search
   terms to identify potentially relevant studies. Search results were assessed against inclusion criteria published in an a
   priori protocol at title, abstract and full-text to determine their suitability for inclusion in the review. Repeatability was
   checked at each stage by comparing a subset between reviewers and testing for inter-rater agreement using Cohen’s
   kappa test. Studies deemed relevant at full text were coded against bibliographic, inclusion and study design criteria
   to create a searchable database of evidence.
   Results: Searches retrieved over 15,700 results yet only sixteen cases met criteria for inclusion in the systematic map.
   Most of this evidence represents first records of impacts from different areas, and in particular first reports of transmis-
   sion of exotic diseases by introduced mosquito species.
   Conclusions: There is currently limited published evidence demonstrating a change in the occurrence, frequency
   or severity of human health impacts caused by alien species in Europe over the last 25 years. Relevant studies relate
   to only a few species, often report specific cases and rarely link health impacts with ecology, distribution or spread
   of the species. Difficulties in attributing human health impacts, such as stings or allergies, to a specific alien species
   likely complicate attempts to measure changes, as may differences in professional interests between the environ-
   mental and health professions. Future studies could helpfully compare spread or abundance with reported, rather
   than potential, health impacts. Better cooperation between invasion ecologists and health professionals working in
   affected areas are likely to be necessary to improve the evidence base on this topic for the future.

Background
Alien species are frequently considered a serious envi-
ronmental threat but some have impacts detrimental
to human health through injury, allergy, or as vectors of
disease ([1–3]; Table 1). Climate change and increasing
propagule pressure due to international trade are likely to
change the spread, abundance, physiology or phenology of
alien species [4–6], potentially also altering their human
health impacts [1]. Many alien species will likely benefit                         Fig. 1 Components of global change drive changes in the distribu-

   Perhaps the greatest threat to human health in Europe
currently posed by alien species is the transmission of
exotic diseases by non-native arthropods. Some patho-
gens have the potential to significantly affect large num-
bers of citizens within relatively short time frames, as
demonstrated for example by the outbreak of Chikun-
gunya fever in Italy (e.g. [32]). Despite a relative lack of
evidence within this map on allergenic plant species,
sensitivity to A. artemisiifolia appears to be increasing in
Europe. There is much data available in the literature (for
example on pollen loads and season lengths) that sug-
gests the spread of this allergenic species will continue
to increase the burden on health care systems result-
ing from the treatment of long-term allergic conditions.          Fig. 3 Drivers of global change cause changes in the distribution
