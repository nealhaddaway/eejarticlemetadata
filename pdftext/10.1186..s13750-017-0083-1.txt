   Abstract
   Background: Habitat is the foundation for healthy and productive fisheries. For substrate spawning fish, lack of
   appropriate spawning substrate is inherently limiting and a lack of access to suitable spawning habitat will lead to
   population collapse. When specific properties of a habitat (e.g., temperature, depth, vegetation composition) are
   matched to the species’ ecological niche, a spawning habitat can be created or enhanced as a means of mitigating
   or offsetting the harmful effects of human development. Given the acceleration of habitat degradation in aquatic
   systems as a result of human activity and resultant loss of biodiversity, it is becoming ever more important to consider
   the effectiveness of the techniques being used to enhance or create habitat, to ensure management resources are
   being allocated wisely. The primary aim of this systematic review will be to assess the effectiveness of techniques cur-
   rently being used to create or enhance spawning habitat for substrate spawning fish in temperate climate regions.
   Methods: This review will examine studies on the effectiveness of habitat creation or enhancement for substrate
   spawning fish. We will consider studies in either the North or South temperate climate regions, and include fresh-
   water, estuarine, coastal, or marine environments. Relevant outcomes will include a range of measures used by
   authors to define effectiveness, including but not limited to the presence of eggs, successful emergence, or improved
   recruitment. This review will obtain relevant studies from online publication databases, specialist websites, and grey
   literature using a range of search engines and networking tools. Additional searches will be conducted using the
   bibliographies of relevant review publications. Study data will be extracted and appraised for quality, including study
   design, confounding factors, and statistical analysis. A narrative synthesis will be compiled and a meta-analysis will be
   completed should the data availability and quality allow for it.

attempt to capture studies of every relevant species. Since it was not feasible to include every possible relevant species name, based on the recommendations of the
