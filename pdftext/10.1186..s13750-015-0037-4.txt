  Abstract
  Background: Invasive alien species are of global concern due to their impacts on biodiversity, related ecosystem
  services and on economy. A number of invasive alien species are also responsible for human health impacts, either
  as carriers (vectors) of pathogens, as causal agents of toxic or allergic reactions (e.g. to pollen or insect stings) or
  injuries. However, there has been relatively little attention given to these human health effects in invasion ecology
  literature, with no attempts to systematically identify and quantify evidence of impacts. It is likely that further
  invasive alien species will benefit from global change as some invasive traits provide high plasticity and therefore
  support adaptation capacities to cope with changing conditions. Thus, global change may lead to new public
  health concerns as invasive alien species expand their range or enter new areas, or may alter the severity of health
  impacts by changing the physiology or quantity of potential allergens or irritants produced. This mapping review
  aims at identifying any evidence for changes in the occurrence, frequency or severity of human health impacts
  resulting from exposure to invasive alien species in Europe over the last 25 years.
  Methods/Design: A systematic search of both ecological and medical literature will be used to identify potentially
  relevant studies using three a priori inclusion criteria, i.e. (i) affected human population in Europe, (ii) exposure to
  alien species, (iii) change in health impact. Studies will be assessed against inclusion criteria at title, abstract and full
  text to determine relevance to the mapping review. Studies deemed relevant will be coded using predetermined
  categories relating to the review inclusion criteria and study design, and recorded in a searchable database.
  Depending on the information available, studies may also be geo-referenced to create a geographic map of the
  evidence. Descriptive statistics will be used to explore key trends in the evidence base. The searchable database of
  studies and their main characteristics will be made available with the final report. It is intended that this systematic
  map will be useful in informing decision making related to the future human health impacts of invasive alien
  species in Europe.

  global change and the management of invasive alien species are currently increasing, but still not implemented in sufficient amount to halt
  global change and invasions of alien species [25]. Thus, medical treatment of invasive alien species’ health impacts is often required.
