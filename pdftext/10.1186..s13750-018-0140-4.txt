Open Synthesis: on the need for evidence
synthesis to embrace Open Science
Neal R. Haddaway1,2*
   Abstract
   The Open Science movement can be broadly summarised as aiming to promote integrity, repeatability and transpar-
   ency across all aspects of research, from data collection to publication. Systematic reviews and systematic maps aim
   to provide a reliable synthesis of the evidence on a particular topic, making use of methods that seek to maximise
   repeatability and comprehensives whilst minimising subjectivity and bias. The central tenet of repeatability is opera-
   tionalised by transparently reporting methodological activities in detail, such that all actions could be replicated and
   verified. To date, evidence synthesis has only partially embraced Open Science, typically striving for Open Method-
   ology and Open Access, and occasionally providing sufficient information to be considered to have Open Data for
   some published reviews. Evidence synthesis communities needs to better embrace Open Science not only to balance
   knowledge access and increase efficiency, but also to increase reliability, trust and reuse of information collected and
   synthesised within a review: concepts fundamental to systematic reviews and maps. All aspects of Open Science
   should be embraced: Open Methodology, Open Data, Open Source and Open Access. In doing so, evidence synthesis
   can be made more equal, more efficient and more trustworthy. I provide concrete recommendations of how CEE and
   others can fully embrace Open Synthesis.
