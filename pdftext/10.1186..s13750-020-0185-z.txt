What evidence exists on the impact
of agricultural practices in fruit orchards
on biodiversity? A systematic map

  Abstract
  Background: Biodiversity loss, partly due to intensification of agriculture, has become a global issue. In this context,
  fruit producers have been looking for nature-friendly production methods. By reducing intensive pesticide use and
  enhancing orchard management, they aim to create habitats suitable for beneficial organisms. Fruit production, espe-
  cially in low-stem orchards, requires several interventions (plant protection, tillage, greenwork) throughout the year,
  each of them representing a disturbance. Thus, an expert system that evaluates and aggregates the impact of individ-
  ual farming activities on a set of biodiversity indicators would be a valuable tool for developing new, less biodiversity-
  damaging scenarios. This expert system should be based on expert knowledge and scientific evidence. Surprisingly,
  our literature searches suggested that international journals contain few publications on the impact of most practices
  (except pesticide use) in orchards on biodiversity in general and beneficial organisms in particular. However, in the
  last decade, an increasing number of published articles have pointed out the rising importance of biodiversity in life
  cycle assessment. We therefore compiled and structured the available evidence to (1) assess the state of research on
  discrete biodiversity indicators and agricultural practices, (2) identify the literature relevant for assessing production
  impact and habitat suitability for supporting biodiversity and (3) provide a wide-ranging overview of existing evi-
  dence of the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity.
  Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in scientific journals, agronomy magazines and across the
  internet in English, German and French. The main reviewer followed a step-by-step eligibility scheme that was vali-
  dated by a Kappa test between two reviewers. Additionally, a third reviewer checked a subset of articles. We mapped
  a large range of parameters, which were structured in code sets. To compute a study validity assessment, we used
  13 parameters that reflected the relevance of each article to the impact of agricultural practices in fruit orchards on
  biodiversity indicator species groups.
  Results: The search returned 947 included articles. The map identified major differences in the attention given to dif-
  ferent indicators and practices over time, ranging from closely investigated (clusters) to neglected (gaps)—e.g. spiders
  and birds or amphibians and reptiles, respectively. The majority of studies were short-term surveys, mainly done in
  low-stem orchards. Main areas studied were Western Europe and Eastern North America. The resulting database is
  presented along with descriptive statistics of the distribution and abundance of evidence across time, interventions
  and outcomes.

  Conclusions: The current systematic map reveals that rigorous and comprehensive investigations on the suitability
  of orchards as perennial habitats for wildlife, run on the long-term and following a holistic approach, are still basically
  lacking. Although evidence base on orchard management effects on particular organisms has grown over the past
  two decades, information to develop reliable close-to-nature management tools and strategies is insufficient. The
  implications for policy and research suggest that—in view of worldwide biodiversity loss, which may cause a major
  threat for food production—a better understanding of the role played by orchards and their management in agricul-
  tural landscapes for biodiversity is required.

Importance accorded by a country or state to the research on the impact of orchard practices on indicator species groups shown in relation to the importance of
fruit production (here pome fruits, stone fruits and olives = PSO) in this country or state. The rank was computed in two steps: (1) the ‘share PSO’ describes the ratio
of fruit production area to the total arable and perennial land area, and (2) this ratio is then set in relation to the number of publications to compute the ‘relevance’.
The ranking was established for 77 countries and states fulfilling three conditions: (1) they have publications, (2) they have PSO production, and (3) the ‘share PSO’ is
greater than 0.1%. The current table shows the list of the 16 countries and states (20%) with the highest relevance (numbers in italics) amended with the states with

For an approximate comparison of countries/states and regions of different acreage, the table shows the area and the total number of field surveys of each country or region. This allows an appreciation of the importance
that the involved institutes, i.e. the affiliation (numbers in italics), assume in research at country and regional level. The table shows all regions with nine and more publications per region (= median of all publications).
If an ARI is involved in the publication, it is noted as such even if the main author is affiliated to another institute; otherwise, the main author’s affiliation is noted. Total of regional studies: Europe = 115, Canada = 46,
