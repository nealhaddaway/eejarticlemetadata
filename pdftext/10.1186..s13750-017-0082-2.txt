  Abstract
  Background: In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the production and use of woodfuel remains an important socio-economic
  activity with more than 70% of the population relying on woodfuel as their primary household energy source. Despite
  their socio-economic significance, woodfuel value chains are often viewed negatively due to their association with
  detrimental health and environmental impacts. However, the lack of sound evidence and limited understanding of the
  role of contextual factors in influencing the various impacts of woodfuel value chains have prevented the formulation
  of properly guided policy interventions. Thus the objective of this systematic map is to provide a comprehensive review
  of the environmental, socio-economic, and health impacts of woodfuel value chains across SSA.
  Methods: The search strategy for this review map was defined in a peer-reviewed protocol and refined by iterative
  testing. Search strings were composed of population, intervention, and location terms and combined using Boolean
  operators. The bibliographic databases Web of Science, Scopus, and CAB Abstracts were used as the main sources of
  literature for this review, and a total of 4728 results were initially retrieved. Following title and abstract screening, 659
  entered full text screening. Critical appraisal of 219 articles led to the exclusion of studies that did not set meet quality
  criteria for this map, resulting in a final total of 131 articles for inclusion in data extraction and analysis.
  Results: From the 131 included articles, 152 individual studies were identified during data extraction. Studies came
  from 26 of the 49 Sub Saharan African countries, with a particular preponderance of articles published in the last
  10 years. Critical appraisal found significant weaknesses in the experimental design of woodfuel value chain studies
  with the exception of health impact studies, which frequently utilized controls or other relevant comparators. Find-
  ings suggest that woodfuel value chains have environmental, socioeconomic and health consequences with the fre-
  quent presence of trade-offs. The reporting of contextual factors in the studies challenge the widespread perception
  of deforestation as being directly caused by bush fires, overgrazing and woodcutting. Instead, agricultural expansion
  (which often includes forest clearing) and pre-existing biophysical factors were the most frequently cited factors in
  shaping environmental outcomes.
  Conclusions: This systematic map suggests that there are environmental, socioeconomic and health consequences
  associated with woodfuel value chains in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the literature also shows a weak and geo-
  graphically limited evidence base to justify the above claims. We argue that policy formulation processes targeting
  woodfuels in SSA require more solid, coherent and broad body of knowledge, especially for such a vital sector in
  rural economies. Thus, there is an urgent need to design and undertake research using robust methodologies, at

Table 2 Study quality assessment criteria
Study components        Criteria
Methodology             Are methods clearly explained and replicable?
                        Is the sampling frequency, duration of study, and sample size (e.g. extrapolations, generalizations) appropriate for answering the
                           question(s) posed by the study?
Study site selection    Is the choice of study site selection clear and justified? This decision will be based on the explanations provided by study authors
                           regarding a study site’s relevance in answering research questions, and is particularly important for the selection of case and
                           control sites in terms of their comparability
Sources of data         Are the sources of data reliable, complete and available in the article? Do authors acknowledge potential biases, consider
                           potential confounding factors, and/or perform triangulation to ascertain research results? The reliability of data will be assessed
                           based on the authors’ acknowledgement of potential biases and if triangulation is performed to ascertain research results
Results                 Are the results clearly linked to the intervention? Is causation of the socioeconomic, environmental, and/or health outcomes
                           clearly attributable to the wood energy activities?
Conclusion              Are the conclusions justified by the results presented? Are the authors’ conclusions about the impact of woodfuel value chain
                           activities supported by their data?
