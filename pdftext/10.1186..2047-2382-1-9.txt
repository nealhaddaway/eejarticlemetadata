Does delaying the first mowing date benefit
biodiversity in meadowland?
Jean-Yves Humbert1*, Jérôme Pellet1,2, Pierrick Buri1 and Raphaël Arlettaz1
  Abstract
  Background: Meadows are regularly mown in order to provide fodder or litter for livestock and to prevent
  vegetation succession. However, the time of year at which meadows should be first mown in order to maximize
  biological diversity remains controversial and may vary with respect to context and focal taxa. We carried out a
  systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of delaying the first mowing date upon plants and invertebrates
  in European meadowlands.
  Methods: Following a CEE protocol, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, JSTOR, Google and Google Scholar
  were searched. We recorded all studies that compared the species richness of plants, or the species richness or
  abundance of invertebrates, between grassland plots mown at a postponed date (treatment) vs plots mown
  earlier (control). In order to be included in the meta-analysis, compared plots had to be similar in all management
  respects, except the date of the first cut that was (mostly experimentally) manipulated. They were also to be
  located in the same meadow type. Meta-analyses applying Hedges’d statistic were performed.
  Results: Plant species richness responded differently to the date to which mowing was postponed. Delaying
  mowing from spring to summer had a positive effect, while delaying either from spring to fall, or from early
  summer to later in the season had a negative effect. Invertebrates were expected to show a strong response to
  delayed mowing due to their dependence on sward structure, but only species richness showed a clearly
  significant positive response. Invertebrate abundance was positively influenced in only a few studies.
  Conclusions: The present meta-analysis shows that in general delaying the first mowing date in European
  meadowlands has either positive or neutral effects on plant and invertebrate biodiversity (except for plant
  species richness when delaying from spring to fall or from early summer to later). Overall, there was also
  strong between-study heterogeneity, pointing to other major confounding factors, the elucidation of which
  requires further field experiments with both larger sample sizes and a distinction between taxon-specific and
  meadow-type-specific responses.

that rows with two outcomes (species richness and abundance) count as two data points. The time (month) of the early and delayed first cut are given for both
