  Abstract
  People have a stake in conservation and environmental management both for their own interests and the sake of the
  environment itself. Environmental decision-making has changed somewhat in recent decades to account for uninten-
  tional impacts on human wellbeing. The involvement of stakeholders in environmental projects has been recognised
  as critical for ensuring their success and equally for the syntheses of evidence of what works, where, and for whom,
  providing key benefits and challenges. As a result of increased interest in systematic reviews of complex management
  issues, there is a need for guidance in best practices for stakeholder engagement. Here, we propose a framework for
  stakeholder engagement in systematic reviews/systematic maps, highlighting recommendations and advice that are
  critical for effective, efficient and meaningful engagement of stakeholders. The discussion herein aims to provide a
  toolbox of stakeholder engagement activities, whilst also recommending approaches from stakeholder engagement
  research that may prove to be particularly useful for systematic reviews and systematic maps.
