Knowledge production
and environmental conflict: managing
systematic reviews and maps for constructive
outcomes
Rasmus Kløcker Larsen1* and Annika E. Nilsson1,2
   Abstract
   Systematic reviews and maps in the environmental field are often carried out in contexts of contestation between
   different knowledge holders and users, placing demands on the review team to constructively relate to different
   interests and perspectives. The aim of this short commentary is to place systematic reviews and maps into a broader
   perspective of conflict management related to knowledge production, including the role of facilitated stakeholder
   involvement. We introduce a brief framework that identifies four dimensions that are relevant for choosing among dif-
   ferent approaches to knowledge production in conflict situations: type of conflict, view of knowledge, model of stake-
   holder involvement, and measure of quality. We also provide some suggestions on how such a framework can be
   applied in connection with planning for systematic reviews and maps. Options include managing conflicts through
   facilitated stakeholder involvement within the review itself as well as a thorough assessment of what specifically the
   method can contribute in relationship to other approaches to knowledge production for environmental management.
