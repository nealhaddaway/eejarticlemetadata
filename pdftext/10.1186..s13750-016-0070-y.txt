grazing and browsing by ungulates on plants
and invertebrates in temperate and boreal
forests? A systematic review protocol

  Abstract
  Background: Livestock grazing and ‘overabundance’ of large wild herbivores in forested areas have long been per-
  ceived as conflicting with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however, certain kinds of herbivory
  can help to maintain habitat values in forest ecosystems. Management of grazing/browsing in protected forests can,
  therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. However, it is not clear what impacts of wild ungulates or
  livestock are tolerable or desirable in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. The primary aim of the proposed
  systematic review is to clarify how the diversity of plants and invertebrates is affected by manipulation of the grazing/
  browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate purpose of the review is to investigate whether such
  manipulation is useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides.
  Methods: The review will examine primary field studies of how fencing or other kinds of manipulation of the graz-
  ing/browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates affects plants or invertebrates. We will consider studies made in
  boreal or temperate forests anywhere in the world, incorporating investigations made not only in protected areas but
  also in stands under commercial management. Non-intervention or alternative levels of grazing pressure will be used
  as comparators. Relevant outcomes include abundance, diversity and composition of plants and invertebrates, tree
  regeneration, and performance of focal/target species. Relevant studies will mainly be selected from a recent system-
  atic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active management in forest set-asides. A search update will be
  made with a subset of the search terms used for the systematic map. Searches for additional literature will be made in
  bibliographies of existing reviews. Relevant studies will be subject to critical appraisal and categorised as having high,
  medium or low susceptibility to bias. Studies with high susceptibility to bias will be excluded from the review. Useful
  outcomes and data on interventions and other potential effect modifiers will be extracted from included articles.
  A narrative synthesis will describe the quality and findings of all studies in the review. Where studies report similar out-
  comes, meta-analysis will be performed.
