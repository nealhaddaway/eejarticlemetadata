   Abstract
   Canada has strong institutional capacity for science-based decision-making related to natural resource conserva-
   tion and environmental management. Yet, the concept of using systematic reviews (conducted in accordance with
   established guidelines) to support evidence-based conservation and environmental management in Canada is in its
   infancy. Here we discuss the Canadian context for implementing more rigorous evidence-based approaches using
   systematic reviews. Of particular relevance to Canada is its vast size, broad diversity of ecosystems and heavy eco-
   nomic reliance on natural resources that vary widely in the type and scale of their environmental effects. These factors
   result in a wide variety of environmental monitoring needs over an extensive area that pose challenges to the scien-
   tific community charged with overseeing wise use of the environment. In addition, there are diverse and engaged
   user groups (e.g., hunters, trappers, fishers, bird watchers, foresters) and indigenous peoples that have constitutional
   rights to their natural resources. Traditional environmental knowledge is a complementary source of evidence in the
   Canadian environmental impact assessment process and therefore must be a part of evidence synthesis. Systematic
   reviews are not intended to replace local field studies, but rather have the opportunity to draw upon a broader suite
   of evidence that can be interfaced with local perspectives. The existing institutional structures in Canada could easily
   incorporate systematic reviews into their science advice and decision-making frameworks but to date, there are few
   examples of where this has occurred. Drawing on the expertise of a growing global collaboration for environmen-
   tal evidence synthesis, Canadian institutions (federal, provincial and NGO) are poised to more broadly incorporate
   systematic reviews once their benefits are fully realized and the capacity to undertake such systematic reviews is fully
   developed. Systematic reviews offer a consolidated view of the available scientific literature on a given question. The
   results may offer significant value when working with stakeholders and decision makers contributing other sources
   of information to the question. For example, mechanisms to capture and integrate scientific knowledge with stake-
   holder and traditional knowledge may benefit from the scientific sources being filtered, interpreted and summarized
   for discussion. In other cases, where timeframes for decision making preclude formal systematic reviews, opportuni-
   ties for more rapid evidence synthesis methods will be needed before the concept will be fully embraced.
